# Session Prompts — 2026-01-01

## Prompts (in sequence)

1. Read the @README.md and using it create a PURPOSE.md file with sections that I can manually fill out for each new project

2. Review the @README.md file as an instruction for me (the only user) who will use this when they want to create a new folder under Claude Code's influence for a discrete non-coding project. Is there enough information? Should I delete the CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md files currently here before I use this `Minimum-Project` folder as a template?

3. Let's discuss. Issue 1. Numbering needs to be fixed. Issue 2. /init is a Claude Code command that initializes a new folder by creating the CLAUDE.md file. That is why I think we should delete the existing CLAUDE.md files as /init will create it (after it automatically reads all files it finds in the folder for context). Issue 3. For /init to do it's work effectively (in my opinion), it should ONLY have README.md and PURPOSE.md in the folder when it starts

4. no thanks. I want you to act as me where I am going to create a new project about writing a very detailed account of the sharp-shinned hawk. I want you to follow the instructions of the README.md to create such a project. You will want to make it personal, but appealing to 18 to 85 year olds. There will be anecdotes (you will specify) inside the account. You will publish versions to my blog, to Twitter as threads, and to Substack as both paid and free subscription versions (with differing content befitting paid vs free). So this is an exercise in whether the README.md and these brief instructions are enough for you to produce a PURPOSE.md file for the new folder

5. Technical Aspects may come into play when researching technical topics. e.g. "Stamp collecting in 2026" or "Field cameras for Naturalists" or "AI in Note-taking"

6. Can you update your PURPOSE.md in the Sharp-Shinned Hawk article to match these revised sections?

7. Let's now continue with the README.md instructions from the Sharp-Shinned Hawk folder. Is there any indication that you (Claude Code) should suggest to me (the user): "Do you want me to create a basic PLAN from what I found in this folder?"

8. I like #4 if it is possible technically. Let's discuss that. If not #4 I choose #3

9. I have decided to ask CC to create the PLAN.md for the Sharp-shinned Hawk folder. Should I quit and open up that folder in CC and invoke /init to see what it does and then to see when the PLAN is created, whether the details in PURPOSE.md were a good start to a PLAN?

10. I agree. All great points. Adjust PURPOSE.md here in the local folder with these new sections. Then you can delete the Sharp-shinned hawk folder as it served its purpose. To get a handle on what sections we need

11. I am beginning to see that there is a need for project types. A single PURPOSE.md will not be suitable for nature publication projects and researching video sharing providers, and stamp collecting. The sections are too vast and of potentially different levels of granularity (even hierarchies). I think I will be best served with creating PURPOSE.md files for each arbitrary project type as time goes on. To achieve that I am wondering if project types should be formalized (say subfolders in the current "Minimum-Project" folder, each with a specific section list, or whether I should just go with the flow and leave the current PURPOSE.md the same and add to the README.md a step that once this folder is copied, the user (me) should adapt the section structure in PURPOSE.md to suit and then fill each section out as already set forth there in README.md. Let's discuss

12. I love the Hybrid approach. A section library. See what you can come up with to identify common sections and create the rudiments of a Section library in README.md to handle examples we have speculated upon so far

13. My first real project is coming up. I want a folder where I create skills that take communication threads and summarize them for impact, decision tasks for me to do and expected task accomplishments for me to watch for. The output will be in markdown (not files but text I can copy) that I will paste into Obsidian notes. I will start with Slack channels, Telegram channels and email threads. Please create me a new sibling folder to "Minimum-Project" called "Comm-Helpers" and go as far as creating the PURPOSE.md file as best you can. Add any needed "extra" sections to accomplish this as you see fit. And sections you do add, also add to the README.md inside "Minimum-Project"

14. I can see ~/MyResearch/PL-Agreement/.claude/commands/r-commit.md, Can you?

15. I should be able to invoke it with /r-commit but it does not show and jumps to /par-commit instead. Can you explain why that is?

16. can you tell what folder you are in right now in this terminal session?

17. I see. We have been making changes to subfolders all this session?

18. I thought (I know?) we started in the Minimum-Project folder. Can you confirm?
