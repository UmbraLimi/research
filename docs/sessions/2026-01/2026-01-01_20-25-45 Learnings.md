# Session Learnings — 2026-01-01

## Template Design

- **PURPOSE.md sections should be customizable per project type** — A single fixed template doesn't serve diverse projects (writing, research, hobby, tool development). A "Section Library" approach lets users pick relevant sections.

- **Core sections apply universally** — Goals, Background Information, Personal Context, Concerns & Risks, Constraints, and Other Notes work for any project type.

- **PURPOSE.md answers "what" and "where", PLAN.md answers "how"** — PURPOSE.md was good for content and destination but weak on workflow/process. Adding "Workflow & Process" section helped bridge this gap.

- **Don't include files that will be generated** — Removed CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md from template since `/init` creates CLAUDE.md and CC creates PLAN.md during setup. Template should only contain what user fills out.

## Workflow & Process

- **Test templates by using them** — The Sharp-Shinned-Hawk exercise revealed gaps (missing sections, unclear instructions) that wouldn't have been found by just reading the template.

- **Iterative refinement works** — Started with basic PURPOSE.md, tested it, found gaps, added sections, tested again. Each iteration improved the template.

- **README.md instructions should prompt CC behavior** — Adding "CC should offer to create PLAN.md" to README.md step 4 is a soft way to influence /init behavior without creating custom commands.

## Section Library Insights

- **Project types blend** — Most real projects mix categories (the hawk project was writing + research + multi-platform). "Mix and Match" guidance acknowledges this.

- **New project type emerged: Skill & Tool Development** — Comm-Helpers project needed sections not in existing categories: Input Sources, Output Format, Requirements, Use Cases.

## Claude Code Architecture

- **Project-level commands require launching from project folder** — `/r-commit` in a subfolder's `.claude/commands/` is only visible when Claude Code is started from that subfolder. Parent-level commands (`/par-*`) are visible from anywhere in the repo.

- **Working directory matters for command availability** — This session ran from `MyResearch/` root, which was correct for template editing but wouldn't have had access to project-level `/r-*` commands.
