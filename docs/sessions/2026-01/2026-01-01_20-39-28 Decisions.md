# Session Decisions — 2026-01-01

## Decision 1: Remove CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md from Template

**Context**: Discussing what files should be in Minimum-Project template for /init to work effectively.

**Options Considered**:
1. Keep CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md as editable templates
2. Remove them so /init creates CLAUDE.md fresh, and CC creates PLAN.md ← Chosen

**Decision**: Delete CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md from the template. Only README.md and PURPOSE.md should exist when /init runs.

**Rationale**: /init reads all files in folder for context. Having only README.md (instructions) and PURPOSE.md (user input) gives /init clean context to generate a focused CLAUDE.md.

## Decision 2: Keep docs/ and .claude/ Folder Structures

**Context**: Deciding what to keep vs. remove from template after removing CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md.

**Options Considered**:
1. Remove everything except README.md and PURPOSE.md
2. Keep docs/sessions/ and .claude/commands/ structures ← Chosen

**Decision**: Keep the folder structures because slash commands depend on them.

**Rationale**: /par-learnings and /par-prompts write to docs/sessions/, and /r-commit lives in .claude/commands/. These are infrastructure, not content.

## Decision 3: Section Library Instead of Formalized Project Type Subfolders

**Context**: Recognizing that a single PURPOSE.md won't suit all project types (writing, research, hobby, tool development).

**Options Considered**:
1. Formalized subfolders in Minimum-Project, each with specific PURPOSE.md
2. Single flexible template + README step to adapt sections ← Chosen (as hybrid with Section Library)

**Decision**: Keep one template but add a "Section Library" to README.md that lists possible sections by project type.

**Rationale**: User hasn't done enough projects to know what types really are. Adapting sections is valuable thinking. Patterns can be formalized later once they emerge organically.

## Decision 4: README.md Instruction for PLAN.md Offer (Not /r-init Wrapper)

**Context**: Wanting CC to proactively offer to create PLAN.md after /init runs.

**Options Considered**:
1. Update README step 4 to instruct CC behavior
2. Build it into /init (not configurable)
3. Add instruction to CLAUDE.md that /init creates ← Chosen
4. Create /r-init wrapper command

**Decision**: Add instruction to README.md step 4 that CC should offer PLAN.md creation. Safe and explicit approach.

**Rationale**: Option 4 (/r-init wrapper) uncertain if custom commands can invoke built-in commands. README.md instruction is explicit and will be read by /init.

---

## Decision 5: Add "Workflow & Process" Section to PURPOSE.md

**Context**: After testing template with Sharp-Shinned-Hawk project, found PURPOSE.md was good for "what" and "where" but weak on "how".

**Options Considered**:
1. Accept gap — PURPOSE.md is about content, PLAN.md is about process
2. Add "Workflow & Process" section to PURPOSE.md ← Chosen

**Decision**: Add new section to capture how user likes to work and any phases they envision.

**Rationale**: Helps CC generate better PLAN.md by understanding user's work style. Low cost to add, high value for planning.
