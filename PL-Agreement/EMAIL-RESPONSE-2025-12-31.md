**Re:** Alpha Peer Engagement Letter - Ready to Sign

Brian,

Thank you for the revised agreement. I've reviewed the 12.31 version and appreciate the lawyer addressing the items I raised:

- Remote proceedings option added
- Prevailing party fee recovery included
- Non-compete duration clarified (2 years for the core restrictions)
- Email address corrected

The restructured non-compete makes sense - time-limited restrictions on direct competition, with a permanent restriction on misusing confidential information. That's fair.

I'm ready to sign. Let me know how you'd like to proceed - I can sign electronically or we can arrange for physical signatures.

Happy New Year, and looking forward to continuing the build.

Best,

Fraser
