## Changes from 12.29 to 12.31

### Our Requests - All Addressed

| Request | 12.29 Version | 12.31 Version | Status |
|---------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **Remote proceedings (11c)** | Not present | "To the extent permitted by applicable rules and the court, proceedings may be conducted remotely by video conference." | Added |
| **Prevailing party fees (11d)** | "...and the Parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator." | "...provided, however, that the prevailing Party in any litigation shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party." | Added |
| **Email brackets (13)** | `[fraser@meristics.com]` | `fraser@meristics.com` | Fixed |
| **Non-compete duration (12j)** | "thereafter" (undefined) | "for a period of two (2) years thereafter" | Clarified |

### Additional Changes by Lawyer

#### Section 5(d) - No Use for Third Parties
- Added "Confidential Client Information" to the list of restricted items
- Impact: Minor tightening, consistent with other confidentiality provisions

#### Section 12(j) - Non-Competition (Restructured)

The non-compete was split into two distinct restrictions with different durations:

| Restriction | Duration | Practical Meaning |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Building competing platform | 2 years post-termination | Can build competing ed-tech after 2 years |
| Soliciting users/customers | 2 years post-termination | Can approach users after 2 years |
| Using Confidential Info/Client Materials/Deliverables to compete | Forever | Can never use their proprietary information |

**Assessment:** This is a reasonable compromise. The time-limited restrictions allow Developer to eventually work in the same space, while the permanent restriction on using Client's confidential information is standard and appropriate.

#### Effective Date
- Filled in as "31st day of December, 2025"

## Key Protections in Final Document

### Favorable to Developer
- **Prevailing party fee recovery** - Discourages frivolous lawsuits
- **Remote proceedings permitted** - Reduces travel burden for Ontario-based contractor
- **Change of Control provision (12k)** - Can terminate or renegotiate if Brian loses control
- **2x cap on IP indemnity** - Limits exposure for IP claims
- **Warranty work is billable** - Bug fixes through paid SOWs, not free
- **3-year confidentiality survival** - Not indefinite (except trade secrets)
- **Archival copy retention** - Can keep one copy for legal compliance

### Standard Provisions
- Work-for-hire ownership to Client
- Louisiana law and venue
- Mutual confidentiality
- Client representations and warranties
- Force majeure

---

## Remaining Considerations

### Non-Compete Structure
The restructured non-compete in Section 12(j) creates a two-tier system:
1. **2-year restriction** on directly competing or soliciting users
2. **Permanent restriction** on using confidential information to compete

This is reasonable because:
- You retain the right to work in ed-tech generally
- After 2 years, you can build competing products using your own skills/knowledge
- The permanent restriction only applies to misusing their proprietary information (which you shouldn't do anyway)

### Nuisance Lawsuit Protection
The prevailing party fee provision in Section 11(d) addresses the concern about frivolous litigation. If someone brings a weak claim and loses, they pay the other side's legal fees.

### Change of Control
Section 12(k) already protects Developer if Brian sells or loses control. Developer can terminate or renegotiate within 60 days of any change of control.

## Recommendation

The 12.31.25 version addresses all raised concerns. The document is ready for signature.
