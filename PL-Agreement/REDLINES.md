# Proposed Redlines

This document tracks suggested changes to the Alpha Peer Engagement Letter.

**Legend:**
- ~~strikethrough~~ = remove
- **bold** = add
- [brackets] = notes/options

---

## Preamble (Page 1)

### Change 1: Clarify corporate capacity and fix typo

**Current:**
> The Technifar Corporation, a ____________ corporation d/b/a Meristics, represented hereby its duly authorized representative, Fraser Gorrie ("Developer")

**Proposed:**
> The Technifar Corporation, an **Ontario, Canada** corporation d/b/a Meristics, represented ~~hereby~~ **herein** by its duly authorized ~~representative~~ **officer and employee**, Fraser Gorrie ("Developer")

**Reason:** Clarifies Fraser acts as employee of corporation, not independent party. Fills in missing jurisdiction. Fixes typo.

---

## Section 12 - General Provisions (Page 4-5)

### Change 2: Add No Personal Liability clause + Update Signature Block

**Add new subsection 12(e):**

> **(e) No Personal Liability.** Fraser Gorrie is signing this Agreement solely in his capacity as an officer and employee of The Technifar Corporation. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impose any personal liability on Fraser Gorrie individually, and Client agrees to look solely to The Technifar Corporation for performance of Developer's obligations hereunder.

**Also update Signature Page:**

Change Developer signature block from:
> Fraser Gorrie
> ~~Duly Authorized Representative~~

To:
> Fraser Gorrie
> **President**

**Reason:** Belt-and-suspenders protection to make corporate liability limitation explicit. Signature block should match the preamble and 12(e) language identifying Fraser's corporate role.

---

## Section 2 - Services and Deliverables (Page 2)

### Change 3: Clarify "timely" means per SOW

**Current:**
> Developer hereby agrees to timely provide the Services and the Deliverables

**Proposed:**
> Developer hereby agrees to ~~timely~~ provide the Services and the Deliverables **in accordance with the timelines set forth in the applicable SOW**

**Reason:** "Timely" is vague; tie to SOW-defined schedules.

---

### Change 4: Clarify revisions use block hours

**Current:**
> If not approved by Client, acting reasonably and in good faith, such Services and Deliverables shall be promptly revised and resubmitted by Developer for Client's review and approval.

**Proposed:**
> If not approved by Client, acting reasonably and in good faith, such Services and Deliverables shall be promptly revised and resubmitted by Developer for Client's review and approval. **All such revisions shall become part of the current SOW and expend its block hours.**

**Reason:** Clarifies that revisions use prepaid block hours (no unlimited free revisions). Aligns with the prepaid block model.

---

### Change 5: Clarify SOW superseding structure

**Add to Recitals or Section 2:**

> **Each SOW shall set forth the Services and Deliverables for a defined block of prepaid hours. Upon execution of a new SOW, such SOW shall supersede all prior SOWs with respect to the scope of Services and Deliverables to be performed, except that all terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply. Work items from prior SOWs not completed may be carried forward into a new SOW by mutual agreement.**

**Reason:** Reflects the actual prepaid block/SOW structure already in use.

---

## Section 3 - Compensation (Page 2)

### Change 6: Insert complete compensation terms

**Current:**
> [Parties to insert description of compensation terms/methodology; invoicing terms; etc.]

**Proposed replacement:**

> **3. Compensation.**
>
> **(a) Hourly Rate.** Client shall compensate Developer at the rate of One Hundred Fifty U.S. Dollars ($150.00 USD) per hour for all Services performed.
>
> **(b) Prepaid Blocks.** Services shall be performed in prepaid blocks of hours. Prior to the commencement of each block, the Parties shall mutually agree on the number of hours in the block, and Client shall prepay for such hours upon receipt of Developer's invoice. Each block shall be accompanied by a Statement of Work describing the intended scope of Services for that block.
>
> **(c) Payment Terms.** All invoices are due and payable upon receipt. Payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars via Wise transfer to Developer's designated Wise account, or by such other method as the Parties may agree in writing.
>
> **(d) Expenses.** Third-party services, hosting, software licenses, and similar project costs shall be paid directly by Client. In the event Developer incurs any project-related expenses (such as API usage charges), Developer shall notify Client and the Parties shall mutually determine responsibility for such costs. Any expenses to be reimbursed to Developer shall be invoiced separately and paid via Wise transfer.
>
> **(e) Rate Adjustment.** Developer's hourly rate may be adjusted upon mutual written agreement of the Parties. Any rate adjustment shall apply to SOWs executed after the date of such agreement.
>
> **(f) Work Stoppage.** If any prepaid block is exhausted and a new block has not been agreed upon and prepaid, Developer shall have no obligation to continue performing Services until a new block is established.

**Reason:** Formalizes existing prepaid block arrangement. Protects against non-payment. Establishes clear payment expectations.

---

## Section 4 - Termination (Page 2)

### Change 7: Make convenience termination mutual

**Current:**
> This Agreement (including any or all SOWs) may also be terminated by Client for its convenience without penalty or termination fee, but only upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to Developer.

**Proposed:**
> This Agreement (including any or all SOWs) may also be terminated by **either Party** for ~~its~~ **such Party's** convenience without penalty or termination fee, but only upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to **the other Party**.

**Reason:** Balances termination rights. If client can walk away, developer should be able to as well.

---

### Change 8: Add termination payment/transition provisions

**Add to Section 4:**

> **Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement:**
>
> **(i)** Client shall pay Developer for all Services performed and expenses incurred through the effective date of termination.
>
> **(ii)** With respect to prepaid blocks: any unused prepaid hours shall be refunded to Client on a pro-rata basis.
>
> **(iii)** Developer shall deliver to Client all completed Deliverables and work-in-progress as of the termination date.
>
> **(iv)** Each Party shall return or destroy the other Party's Confidential Information in accordance with Section 6(c).

**Reason:** Clarifies what happens to money and work product upon termination. Pro-rata refund of unused hours is fair to both parties.

---

## Section 5 - Ownership/IP (Pages 2-3)

### Analysis Summary

- **5(a) Work for Hire** - Standard, no change needed. Aligns with developer's approach.
- **5(c) Background Technology** - Acceptable. Developer won't use pre-existing code anyway.
- **5(e) Indefinite Survival** - **Fair and standard** for IP provisions. IP assignments are inherently permanent.

---

### Change 9: Clarify 5(b) Further Assurances - add time and compensation limits

**Current:**
> Developer agrees to execute, and to cause its personnel (if applicable) to execute, such documents and take such actions as Client may reasonably request to perfect, maintain, or enforce Client's rights in the Deliverables.

**Proposed:**
> Developer agrees to execute, and to cause its personnel (if applicable) to execute, such documents and take such actions as Client may reasonably request to perfect, maintain, or enforce Client's rights in the Deliverables. **Client shall provide Developer with reasonable advance notice of any such request, and if such request is made more than six (6) months after termination of this Agreement, Client shall compensate Developer at Developer's then-current hourly rate for time spent responding to such request.**

**Reason:** Prevents open-ended obligation to sign paperwork years later without compensation.

---

### Change 10: Clarify 5(d) doesn't restrict general knowledge

**Current:**
> Developer shall not use any Client Materials or Deliverables (including the structure, sequence, organization, or unique features thereof) to develop software or services for any third party...

**Proposed:**
> Developer shall not use any Client Materials or Deliverables (including the structure, sequence, organization, or unique features thereof) to develop software or services for any third party... **For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5(d) shall restrict Developer's use of general programming skills, knowledge, techniques, or experience gained during the performance of Services, provided that Developer does not use or disclose any Confidential Client Information.**

**Reason:** Protects developer's ability to continue working as a developer using general knowledge gained.

---

## Section 6 - Confidentiality (Page 3)

### Change 11: Make confidentiality mutual

**Current:** Only Developer has confidentiality obligations.

**Add new Section 6(d):**

> **(d) Mutual Confidentiality.** Client shall hold in confidence any confidential business information disclosed by Developer, including Developer's rates, business methods, and information about Developer's other clients. Client shall not disclose such information to third parties without Developer's prior written consent.

**Reason:** Fairness. Developer may share sensitive business information that deserves protection.

---

### Change 12: Limit confidentiality survival period

**Current:**
> Developer's obligations pursuant to this Section 6 shall indefinitely survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Engagement Letter.

**Proposed:**
> Developer's obligations pursuant to this Section 6 shall ~~indefinitely~~ survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Engagement Letter **for a period of three (3) years; provided, however, that obligations with respect to trade secrets shall survive for so long as such information remains a trade secret under applicable law.**

**Reason:** Indefinite confidentiality is unreasonable. 3 years is industry standard. Trade secrets get separate, longer protection by law anyway.

---

### Change 13: Allow archival copy retention

**Current:**
> ...at Client's option, return or destroy all copies of Confidential Client Information and Client Materials, certifying such destruction in writing upon Client's request.

**Proposed:**
> ...at Client's option, return or destroy all copies of Confidential Client Information and Client Materials, certifying such destruction in writing upon Client's request. **Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer may retain one (1) archival copy of Confidential Client Information solely for legal compliance and dispute resolution purposes, subject to Developer's ongoing confidentiality obligations.**

**Reason:** Protects Developer in case of later disputes about what was delivered or disclosed.

---

## Section 7 - Representations and Warranties (Page 3)

### Changes 14-15: Simplify Section 7 warranty structure

**Rationale:** The original 24-month free warranty period doesn't fit the prepaid block/SOW model. The MVP is the actual deliverable, and post-MVP defect corrections should be handled as paid work through subsequent blocks. This aligns with how the engagement actually works.

**Replace Section 7(b) through 7(d) with:**

> **(b)** Following Developer's delivery of the final Deliverable (or, if applicable, Client's written acceptance thereof), Developer shall correct any reproducible defect or nonconformity in the Deliverable reported by Client through a subsequent block of hours with an appropriate SOW.
>
> **(c)** Developer shall have no warranty obligations with respect to any Deliverable that Client has modified or permitted others to modify without Developer's written consent.
>
> **(d)** Client represents and warrants that: (i) it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement; (ii) all Client Materials provided to Developer are owned by or properly licensed to Client, and do not infringe any third party's intellectual property rights; and (iii) Client will provide timely feedback, approvals, and decisions as reasonably necessary for Developer to perform the Services.

**What this does:**
- Removes 24-month free warranty period entirely
- Post-MVP defect fixes become paid work under new block/SOW (aligns with prepaid block model)
- Retains protection against warranty claims for Client-modified code
- Adds Client warranties for balance

---

## Section 8 - IP Indemnity (Pages 3-4)

### Change 16: Cap indemnification liability

**Current:**
> Developer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Client... from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses...

**Proposed:**
> Developer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Client... from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses... **Developer's aggregate liability under this Section 8 shall not exceed two (2) times the total amounts paid by Client to Developer under this Agreement.**

**Reason:** Unlimited indemnification is unreasonable. Caps exposure at 2x contract value.

---

### Change 17: Add exclusion for third-party/open source components

**Add to Section 8(c):**

> **(iii)** claims arising from third-party software, libraries, frameworks, or open source components not created by Developer, provided that Developer has used such components in accordance with their applicable licenses; or
>
> **(iv)** claims arising from Client's specifications or requirements that necessarily result in infringement.

**Reason:** Developer shouldn't indemnify for open source library issues or Client-mandated design choices.

---

### Change 18: Limit indemnity survival period

**Current:**
> Developer's obligations pursuant to this Section 8 shall indefinitely survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Engagement Letter.

**Proposed:**
> Developer's obligations pursuant to this Section 8 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Engagement Letter **for a period of three (3) years.**

**Reason:** Indefinite indemnification is unreasonable. 3 years allows reasonable time for claims to surface while limiting long-term exposure.

---

### Change 19: Add mutual indemnification

**Add new Section 8(e):**

> **(e) Client Indemnification.** Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Developer from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to: (i) any claim that Client Materials infringe any intellectual property right of a third party; (ii) Client's use of the Deliverables in violation of applicable law; or (iii) Client's breach of this Agreement.

**Reason:** Indemnification should be mutual. If Client provides infringing materials or misuses the deliverables, Client should indemnify Developer.

---

### Change 20: Add indemnification procedures

**Add new Section 8(f):**

> **(f) Indemnification Procedures.** The indemnified Party shall: (i) promptly notify the indemnifying Party of any claim; (ii) give the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement; and (iii) provide reasonable cooperation at the indemnifying Party's expense. The indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim in a manner that admits liability or imposes obligations on the indemnified Party without such Party's prior written consent.

**Reason:** Standard indemnification procedure language protects both parties.

---

## Section 9 - Limited Warranty (Page 4)

### Analysis Summary

**No changes needed.** This section is favorable to Developer.

- Limits warranties to only those expressly stated in Section 7
- Disclaims implied warranties (merchantability, fitness for purpose)
- Disclaims compliance with laws/regulations applicable to project

This protects Developer from claims of implied promises.

---

## Section 10 - Limitation on Liability (Page 4)

### Change 21: Narrow the exceptions to the liability cap (BOTH 10(a) and 10(b))

**Current exceptions (in both 10(a) and 10(b)):**
> Except for liability arising from (a) Developer's intellectual property indemnity obligations, (b) Developer's breach of its confidentiality obligations, or (c) Developer's gross negligence or willful misconduct

**Proposed (apply to BOTH 10(a) and 10(b)):**
> Except for liability arising from ~~(a) Developer's intellectual property indemnity obligations, (b) Developer's breach of its confidentiality obligations, or (c)~~ Developer's gross negligence or willful misconduct

**Important:** This change must be applied to BOTH Section 10(a) (liability cap) AND Section 10(b) (consequential damages waiver) to maintain internal consistency.

**Reason:**
- IP indemnity is already capped separately in Change 16 (2x contract value)
- Confidentiality breach shouldn't have unlimited exposure - a cap should apply
- Gross negligence/willful misconduct is a reasonable carve-out (you should be liable for intentional bad acts)

---

### Change 22: Make liability limitations mutual

**Current:** Only Developer's liability is capped. Client has no cap.

**Add to Section 10:**

> **(c) Mutual Application.** Except as specifically provided in Section 8 with respect to intellectual property indemnification, the limitations of liability set forth in this Section 10 shall apply equally to both Parties. In no event shall either Party's aggregate liability to the other Party exceed the total amounts paid or payable by Client to Developer under this Agreement.

**Reason:** If your liability is capped, Client's should be too. Fairness. The carve-out for Section 8 clarifies that the IP indemnity cap (2x) is a specific exception to this general cap (1x).

---

### Change 23: Add mutual consequential damages waiver

**Current:** Only Developer waives consequential damages.

**Revise Section 10(b) opening:**

**Current:**
> Except for liability arising from (a)... in no event shall Developer be liable for any lost data...

**Proposed:**
> Except for liability arising from ~~(a) Developer's intellectual property indemnity obligations, (b) Developer's breach of its confidentiality obligations, or (c)~~ **a Party's** gross negligence or willful misconduct, in no event shall **either Party** be liable **to the other** for any lost data or content, lost profits, business interruption or for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages...

**Reason:** Consequential damages waiver should be mutual. Neither party should be liable for the other's lost profits, etc.

---

## Section 11 - Governing Law and Venue (Page 4)

### Change 24: Add arbitration as dispute resolution mechanism

**Current:**
> Any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties relating to the Engagement Letter or the Services shall be heard in any court of competent jurisdiction situated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

**Proposed replacement:**

> **11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.**
>
> **(a) Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles.
>
> **(b) Informal Resolution.** Before initiating any formal dispute resolution, the Parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation. Either Party may initiate informal negotiations by providing written notice to the other Party describing the dispute. The Parties shall meet (in person or by video conference) within fourteen (14) days of such notice to attempt resolution.
>
> **(c) Arbitration.** Any dispute not resolved through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the Parties, or if the Parties cannot agree, selected by the AAA. The arbitration may be conducted remotely by video conference. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
>
> **(d) Costs.** Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs in any dispute resolution proceeding, and the Parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.
>
> **(e) Small Claims Exception.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may bring an action in small claims court for disputes within the jurisdictional limits of such court.

**Reason:**
- Arbitration is faster, cheaper, and can be done remotely (video conference)
- Fairer to Canadian developer than requiring travel to Louisiana courts
- Informal resolution step encourages working things out before escalating
- Louisiana law is acceptable as governing law (substantive rules)
- Removing exclusive Baton Rouge venue levels the playing field

---

## Section 12 - General Provisions (Pages 4-5)

### Analysis Summary (Your Concern #10)

**Section 12(a) - Counterpart Execution:** You and Brian can sign separate copies (including electronic/scanned). Standard and helpful - no change needed.

**Section 12(b) - Recitals:** The "WHEREAS" statements at the beginning are legally binding, not just introductory text. Standard - no change needed.

**Section 12(c) - Entire Agreement:** Only this written agreement counts, not prior verbal promises. Standard - no change needed.

**Section 12(d) - Amendment:** Changes require written agreement signed by both. Standard - no change needed.

*(Note: Change 2 already added Section 12(e) - No Personal Liability)*

---

### Change 25: Add Independent Contractor clause

**Add new Section 12(f):**

> **(f) Independent Contractor.** Developer is an independent contractor and not an employee, partner, or joint venturer of Client. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create an employment, agency, or partnership relationship. Developer shall be solely responsible for all taxes, withholdings, and other statutory obligations related to Developer's compensation.

**Reason:** Clarifies employment status. Important for tax purposes and liability protection for both parties.

---

### Change 26: Add Assignment clause

**Add new Section 12(g):**

> **(g) Assignment.** Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Client may assign this Agreement to any successor entity in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Client's assets, upon written notice to Developer.

**Reason:** Prevents either party from transferring the contract without consent. Exception for acquisition protects Brian's ability to bring in investors/acquirers (his stated goal).

---

### Change 27: Add Severability clause

**Add new Section 12(h):**

> **(h) Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, and the invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

**Reason:** If a court strikes down one clause, the whole contract doesn't fail. Standard protective clause.

---

### Change 28: Add Waiver clause

**Add new Section 12(i):**

> **(i) Waiver.** The failure of either Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such Party's right to enforce such provision or any other provision in the future.

**Reason:** If Brian doesn't enforce a term once, he can still enforce it later (and vice versa). Prevents "you didn't complain before" arguments.

---

### Change 29: Add Non-Compete clause (Addresses Concern #6)

**Add new Section 12(j):**

> **(j) Non-Competition.** During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following its termination, Developer agrees not to: (i) develop, design, or build a software application that directly competes with PeerLoop's core functionality as an online peer-based educational platform; (ii) use any Confidential Client Information, Client Materials, or Deliverables to create a competing product; or (iii) solicit or encourage any of Client's users, customers, or course creators to use a competing platform. This restriction shall not prevent Developer from providing general web development services to other clients in the education sector, provided such services do not involve creating a direct competitor to PeerLoop.

**Reason:** Demonstrates good faith to Client and future investors/acquirers. Narrow enough to allow Developer to continue working in the industry. 2-year limit is reasonable.

---

### Change 30: Add Change of Control provision (Addresses Concern #6)

**Add new Section 12(k):**

> **(k) Change of Control.** The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement reflects a working relationship based on mutual trust between Developer and Brian LeBlanc personally. In the event of a Change of Control of Client, Developer shall have the right, exercisable within sixty (60) days of receiving written notice of such Change of Control, to either: (i) terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' written notice without penalty; or (ii) request renegotiation of the terms of this Agreement, in which case the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. If renegotiation is requested but the Parties are unable to reach agreement within such period, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice. For purposes of this Section, "Change of Control" means: (A) the sale or transfer of more than forty-nine percent (49%) of the ownership interests in Client; (B) a merger, consolidation, or similar transaction in which Brian LeBlanc ceases to control the day-to-day operations of Client; or (C) the sale of all or substantially all of Client's assets.

**Reason:** Acknowledges the personal nature of the relationship. Gives Developer the option (not obligation) to exit or renegotiate if ownership changes. Supports Client's investor goals while protecting Developer from being bound to unknown parties.

---

## Missing Provisions to Add

### Missing 1: Notices Section (Addresses Concerns #2 and #3)

**Add new Section 13 - Notices:**

> **13. Notices.** All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by email to the addresses set forth below (or to such other address as a Party may designate by notice):
>
> **If to Client:**
> Brian LeBlanc
> [Address]
> Email: [email address]
>
> **If to Developer:**
> The Technifar Corporation
> Attn: Fraser Gorrie
> Email: fraser@meristics.com
>
> Notices sent by email shall be deemed received upon confirmation of receipt by reply email, read receipt, or other reasonable evidence of delivery. Either Party may update its notice address by providing written notice to the other Party.

**Reason:** Agreement requires written notice but provides no addresses. Email notification is practical for this working relationship.

---

### Missing 2: Client Cooperation (Addresses Concern #11)

**Add new Section 14 - Client Cooperation:**

> **14. Client Cooperation.** Client acknowledges that Developer's ability to perform the Services depends on Client's timely cooperation. Client agrees to:
>
> **(a)** Provide timely access to Client Materials, systems, accounts, and personnel reasonably necessary for Developer to perform the Services;
>
> **(b)** Respond to Developer's requests for information, feedback, or approval within five (5) business days, unless a different timeframe is agreed;
>
> **(c)** Designate a primary point of contact authorized to make decisions on Client's behalf; and
>
> **(d)** Notify Developer promptly of any changes to project requirements or priorities.
>
> If Client's failure to cooperate causes delays in Developer's performance, any affected deadlines shall be extended by a reasonable period, and Developer shall not be liable for such delays.

**Reason:** Protects Developer from being blamed for delays caused by Client. Establishes Client's responsibilities.

---

### Missing 3: Portfolio Rights (Addresses Concern #11)

**Add new Section 15 - Portfolio Rights:**

> **15. Portfolio Rights.** Upon completion of the project or with Client's prior written consent, Developer may include a general description of the Services performed and non-confidential screenshots or descriptions of the Deliverables in Developer's portfolio, website, and marketing materials for the purpose of showcasing Developer's work to prospective clients. Developer shall not disclose Confidential Client Information in such materials without Client's prior written approval.

**Reason:** Allows Developer to reference work for future business development while respecting confidentiality.

---

### Missing 4: Force Majeure (Addresses Concern #11)

**Add new Section 16 - Force Majeure:**

> **16. Force Majeure.** Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, epidemics, pandemics, government actions, power failures, internet or telecommunications failures, or failures of third-party service providers. The affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party and use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the force majeure event.

**Reason:** Protects both parties from liability for events outside their control (e.g., if a cloud provider goes down, or another pandemic occurs).

---

## Exhibit A - Deliverables

**EXHIBIT A**

**DELIVERABLES**

**1. Overall Project Goal**

The ultimate deliverable under this Agreement is a minimum viable product ("MVP") web application for "PeerLoop," an online peer-based educational platform. The MVP will enable course creators to publish educational content and learners to engage with that content in a peer-supported environment.

**2. Iterative Development Approach**

The Parties acknowledge that PeerLoop is in early-stage development and that the specific features, functionality, and technical implementation of the MVP cannot be fully defined at the outset. Accordingly:

**(a)** The Deliverables shall be developed iteratively through a series of prepaid blocks of hours ("Blocks"), each accompanied by a Statement of Work ("SOW").

**(b)** Each SOW shall describe the intended Deliverables for that Block based on the project's status at the time of SOW creation.

**(c)** Upon completion of each Block, the Parties shall evaluate progress and mutually agree on the scope of the next SOW. Features, priorities, and technical approaches may be adjusted based on learnings from prior Blocks.

**(d)** A preliminary Block structure through MVP completion has been outlined by Client and Client's advisor; however, this structure is a planning guide only and will evolve as the project progresses.

**3. MVP Acceptance Criteria**

The MVP shall be deemed complete when the Parties mutually agree in writing that:

**(a)** Core platform functionality has been implemented sufficient for initial user testing and investor demonstration;

**(b)** The application is deployable to a production environment; and

**(c)** Client has accepted the final SOW deliverables in accordance with Section 2 of the Agreement.

**4. Current SOW Reference**

The specific Deliverables currently in progress are set forth in the most recent SOW executed by the Parties, which is incorporated herein by reference.

**Reason:** Establishes a flexible, iterative approach that matches the actual working arrangement. Acknowledges that MVP features cannot be fully defined upfront while providing clear acceptance criteria.

---

## Exhibit B - Services

**EXHIBIT B**

**SERVICES**

**1. Scope of Services**

Developer shall provide the following categories of Services in support of the Deliverables described in Exhibit A:

**(a) Software Development**: Design, coding, testing, and deployment of web application components using the agreed-upon technology stack.

**(b) Technical Consultation**: Advising Client on technology choices, third-party service selection, architecture decisions, and implementation approaches.

**(c) Project Planning**: Collaborating with Client to define SOW scope, estimate effort, prioritize features, and plan Block execution.

**(d) Integration Services**: Connecting third-party services, APIs, and platforms as required for the application's functionality.

**(e) Documentation**: Providing technical documentation reasonably necessary for Client to understand, maintain, and operate the Deliverables.

**2. Block and SOW Structure**

Services shall be performed in sequential Blocks as follows:

**(a)** Prior to each Block, the Parties shall execute a SOW describing the intended Services and Deliverables for that Block.

**(b)** Each SOW represents the Parties' good-faith estimate of what can be accomplished within the Block's prepaid hours. Actual progress may vary based on technical complexity, changing requirements, or unforeseen challenges.

**(c)** Upon execution of a new SOW, such SOW shall supersede all prior SOWs with respect to the scope of Services and Deliverables to be performed, except that all terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply.

**(d)** Work items from prior SOWs not completed may be carried forward into a new SOW by mutual agreement.

**(e)** Either Party may propose adjustments to tasks, priorities, or deliverables during a Block; such adjustments shall be documented in the subsequent SOW.

**3. Preliminary Block Structure**

The Parties have discussed a preliminary Block structure to guide planning through MVP completion. This structure is provided for reference only and shall be refined through successive SOWs:

| Block | Focus Area | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Project setup, tech stack, initial architecture | Completed |
| 2 | As defined in SOW of invoice 437-002 | Work-In-Progress |
| 3+ | Subsequent Blocks to be defined based on progress | Future |

*Note: Block count, scope, and sequencing will evolve based on project progress and changing priorities.*

**4. Current SOW Reference**

The specific Services currently being performed are set forth in the most recent SOW executed by the Parties, which is incorporated herein by reference.

**Reason:** Formalizes the Block/SOW structure already in use. Provides flexibility for scope to evolve while maintaining accountability through documented SOWs. Supports agile development approach that benefits both parties.

## Negotiation Priority Guide

### MUST-HAVE (Dealbreakers)

These protect you from serious risk. Do not sign without them.

| # | Change | Why It's Critical |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 2 | No personal liability clause | Without this, your personal assets could be at risk |
| 6 | Compensation terms | The entire payment structure - without it, nothing is defined |
| 8 | Payment on termination | Ensures you get paid for work done if project ends |
| 14-15 | Simplified warranty (no free period) | Post-MVP fixes are paid work via block/SOW; eliminates 24-month free bug fix exposure |
| 21 | Narrow liability cap exceptions | Without this, the liability cap is meaningless (unlimited exposure) |
| 24 | Arbitration instead of Louisiana courts | You cannot practically litigate in a foreign jurisdiction |
| Missing 1 | Notices section | Agreement requires written notice but has no addresses |

**If Brian refuses these:** Serious red flag. Consider walking away or insisting on professional legal review before proceeding.

### IMPORTANT (Push Hard)

These provide significant protection. Fight for them, but could negotiate specifics.

| # | Change | What You Gain | Negotiation Room |
|---|--------|---------------|------------------|
| 1 | Corporate capacity | Reinforces liability protection | Minor - just clarifying language |
| 5 | SOW superseding structure | Formalizes your working model | Could simplify language |
| 7 | Mutual termination | You can exit, not just Brian | Could extend notice period (30 days?) |
| 12 | Confidentiality limited to 3 years | Not bound forever | Could go to 5 years if pushed |
| 16 | Cap indemnity at 2x | Limits IP claim exposure | Could negotiate to 1x or 3x |
| 17 | Exclude open source | Not liable for React/Next.js IP issues | Critical - don't concede |
| 18 | Indemnity survival 3 years | Not liable for claims 10 years later | Could go to 5 years |
| 22-23 | Mutual liability limits | Fairness - if you're capped, so is he | Standard, should be easy |
| 30 | Change of control exit | Exit/renegotiate if ownership changes | Could adjust threshold |
| Missing 2 | Client cooperation | Not blamed for his delays | Adjust response time (5→7 days?) |

### NICE-TO-HAVE (Concede If Needed)

Good to have, but won't hurt you significantly if dropped.

| # | Change | Why It's Lower Priority |
|---|--------|------------------------|
| 3-4 | Timeline/revision limits | Your SOW flexibility already handles this |
| 9 | Further assurances compensation | Low likelihood of being invoked |
| 10 | General knowledge exception | You start fresh anyway - low practical risk |
| 11 | Mutual confidentiality | Nice, but what secrets would Brian reveal? |
| 13 | Archival copy | Minor protection |
| 19-20 | Mutual indemnity + procedures | Nice for fairness, but you're unlikely to sue Brian |
| 25-28 | Boilerplate (contractor, severability, etc.) | Standard clauses - most lawyers would add anyway |
| 29 | Non-compete | **You're offering this** - it benefits Brian, not you |
| Missing 3 | Portfolio rights | You said you're flexible on this |
| Missing 4 | Force majeure | Rarely invoked; pandemic clause is standard |

### Negotiation Strategy

**Opening position:** Present all 35 modifications as your proposed revisions.

**If Brian pushes back:**
1. First, explain the reasoning (REDLINES.md has rationale for each)
2. Concede "Nice-to-Have" items to show flexibility
3. Hold firm on "Must-Have" items
4. Negotiate specifics on "Important" items (e.g., 3 years → 5 years)

**Good faith gestures you're already making:**
- Change 29: Non-compete (protects his investment)
- Change 26: Assignment clause allows acquisition (supports his investor goals)
- Full IP assignment (you're not retaining any code rights)
- Removed late payment interest (trust)

**Your leverage:**
- He needs you (5 weeks invested, you know the project)
- Good relationship built on trust
- You're being reasonable, not adversarial
- These changes are industry-standard, not unusual
