  - Tech stack decided
  - Many component 3rd party services selected
  - GitHub repo created
- **Code written**: Minimal

---

## Work Arrangement

- **Start date**: November 11, 2025
- **Initial work**: Investigate the project Brian had chosen to proceed with
- **Billing rate**: $150/hr USD
- **Payment model**: Prepaid blocks of hours with accompanying Statement of Work (SOW)

### Payment History

| Invoice | Amount | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1st | $5,250 USD | Work already completed (researching, advising on tech) |
| 2nd | $4,500 USD | Prepaid block of hours |
| **Total** | **$9,750 USD** | |

### Block/SOW Structure

- Each block is prepaid for agreed number of hours
- SOW details proposed work for that block
- SOW is "intended" but not guaranteed - work may take longer/shorter
- New items can be added by client or developer
- When hours are exhausted, new block + revised SOW created
- **Benefits**: Agile, fair to both parties. Client can influence direction quickly. Developer underestimates not penalized. Developer overestimates don't penalize client.
- **Payment timing**: Paid at time of invoice (or day after) - not formalized
- **Payment method**: Wise transfer (Brian's Wise account → Fraser's Canadian Wise account)
  - 1st invoice: Wire transfer to Wise
  - 2nd+ invoices: Wise to Wise
- **Payment status**: Current, no outstanding invoices
- **Expenses**: Client pays directly for third-party services. If Developer incurs costs (e.g., API charges), notify client and decide together; reimbursement via invoice + Wise payment

## Developer's Existing Assets

- **Pre-existing code/frameworks brought in**: None - only standard libraries and frameworks
- **Likelihood of using own existing source code**: Very unlikely
- **Business entity**: The Technifar Corporation d/b/a Meristics
- **Incorporated in**: Ontario, Canada
- **Cross-border note**: Developer is Canadian entity, Client is US entity (Delaware LLC) - potential jurisdiction/tax/currency considerations

---

## Future Expectations

- **Long-term involvement expected**: Yes
  - MVP: 4-6 months
  - Post-MVP to production: 1+ year (released in stages)
  - Total expected engagement: 1.5+ years
- **Equity discussion**: Preliminary offers for the future; nothing formalized
- **Reuse rights desired**: No - gives freely to client, starts fresh each project
  - May reuse same 3rd-party services and libraries (not proprietary)
  - Uses AI (Claude Code) to integrate components uniquely each time
  - Each project's source code is unique
- **Portfolio/reference rights**: Would like, but not a dealbreaker if client prefers not
- **Relationship quality**: Good. High goodwill, developer personally likes client

## Concerns & Risks

### Developer's Identified Concerns

1. **Personal naming vs corporate protection**: Named personally as implementer - worried this breaches corporate veil protection of being an employee of The Technifar Corporation

2. **Notification addresses missing**: Agreement requires written notifications but provides no addresses

3. **Email notification preferred**: Would prefer notifications via email with proof of receipt (reply or similar mechanism)

4. **SOW structure**: Would prefer SOWs be more meaningful, with each SOW superseding the previous one

5. **Liability exceptions too broad**: The exceptions to liability cap and the maximum dollar exposure need to be removed or limited

6. **Non-compete willingness**: Willing to agree not to compete with this product in the future - wants client to feel secure, but unsure if this helps or hurts developer position

7. **Section 7(b) - 24-month warranty problem**: Requires free defect correction for 24 months post-acceptance. Problem: Cannot determine if issues arose from delivered code vs. new code/services introduced later. Burden of proof concern.

8. **Indefinite survival clauses (5e, 6a, 8d)**: Obligations survive "indefinitely" after agreement ends. Is this fair/standard?

9. **Section 11 - Governing law/venue**: Louisiana law, Baton Rouge courts - seems one-sided for Canadian developer

10. **Sections 12a, 12b - Understanding needed**: Unclear what counterpart execution and recitals incorporation mean

11. **Missing developer protections**: What should be added from developer's perspective?

### Client Funding Situation

- **Total project budget**: $250,000 USD reserved
- **MVP budget**: $75,000 USD
- **Budget allocation**: Shared between Gabriel, Guy, and Fraser - most earmarked for development
- **Funding risk**: Low - client has communicated budget availability

## Agreement Negotiation Status

### Current Status (as of December 30, 2025)

**Near final.** Lawyer's composite revisions (12.29.25) accepted majority of Developer's proposed changes.

### Items Remaining Before Signing

| Item | Section | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Dispute Resolution | 11(c)-(d) | Developer requesting: prevailing party fees + remote proceedings |
| Non-Competition | 12(j) | Developer requesting clarification on duration of "thereafter" |
| Notice Address | 13 | Minor edit: remove brackets from Developer email |

### Key Wins for Developer in 12.29.25 Draft

- **Mutual termination rights** - Either party can terminate for convenience
- **Warranty work billable** - Bug fixes done through paid SOW, not free
- **3-year confidentiality limit** - Not indefinite
- **IP indemnity capped at 2x** - Not unlimited
- **Client indemnification added** - Mutual protection
- **Change of Control exit rights** - Can terminate/renegotiate if ownership changes
- **No Personal Liability clause** - Fraser protected from personal liability
- **Non-compete period removed** - Lawyer struck the 2-year post-termination restriction (though "thereafter" needs clarification)

### Items Developer Accepted (Lawyer's Changes)

- Louisiana courts instead of arbitration (with proposed modifications)
- Expenses must be identified in SOW upfront
- Cannot exit mid-SOW without Client consent
- Portfolio rights require prior written consent
- Detailed indemnification procedures
- Gross negligence/willful misconduct excluded from liability caps

### Developer's Approach to Client Relationships

- Deliberately works without formal agreement initially to assess client character
- Risk of non-payment offset by learning client's integrity in business context
- Prefers long-term projects
- Requires personally liking and trusting clients
- 42 years of experience with this approach

### How This Engagement Started

- Gabriel (Fraser's client of 3.25 years, multiple projects) recommended Brian
- Approximately 10 meetings held - one-on-one and with full team

### About Brian (Client)

- **Background**: Owns a pest control business (management level)
- **Project history**: Has tried to start PeerLoop ~15 years, with disappointments and poor vendor relationships
- **Character**: Even-handed, generous, thoughtful, driven
- **Technical ability**: Tech novice, no coding experience, but avid AI user and fearless with new tech
- **Design sense**: Good eye for UI design (no formal training), currently seeking a designer
- **Current prototyping**: Uses Claude Code to vibe-code what PeerLoop might look like
  - Substantial control over effort
  - Has obvious flaws from developer perspective
  - Valuable for sussing out user needs across different user types
  - Fraser will use these screens as planning reference (implementation will differ)
- **Investor interest**: Has wealthy friends wanting to invest; waiting until there's something to show
