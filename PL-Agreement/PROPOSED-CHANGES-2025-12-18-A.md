**Prepared by:** The Technifar Corporation (Developer)
**Date:** December 18, 2025
**Reference Document:** Alpha Peer Engagement Letter (Butler Snow Draft 12.16.25)

---

## Summary

This document contains proposed revisions to the Alpha Peer Engagement Letter. Changes are organized by section for easy reference. Each proposed change includes the current text, proposed revision, and brief rationale.

**Total proposed changes:** 36 (30 revisions to existing text + 4 new sections + 2 exhibits)

---

## Preamble (Page 1)

### Change 1: Clarify Corporate Capacity

**Current:**
> The Technifar Corporation, a ____________ corporation d/b/a Meristics, represented hereby its duly authorized representative, Fraser Gorrie ("Developer")

**Proposed:**
> The Technifar Corporation, an **Ontario, Canada** corporation d/b/a Meristics, represented **herein** by its duly authorized **officer and employee**, Fraser Gorrie ("Developer")

**Rationale:** Fills in missing jurisdiction. Clarifies Fraser acts as employee of corporation. Fixes typo ("hereby" → "herein").

---

## Section 2 - Services and Deliverables (Page 2)

### Change 2: Clarify Timeline Reference

**Current:**
> Developer hereby agrees to timely provide the Services and the Deliverables

**Proposed:**
> Developer hereby agrees to provide the Services and the Deliverables **in accordance with the timelines set forth in the applicable SOW**

**Rationale:** Removes vague "timely" standard; ties performance to SOW-defined schedules.

---

### Change 3: Limit Revision Cycles

**Current:**
> If not approved by Client, acting reasonably and in good faith, such Services and Deliverables shall be promptly revised and resubmitted by Developer for Client's review and approval.

**Proposed:**
> If not approved by Client, acting reasonably and in good faith, such Services and Deliverables shall be promptly revised and resubmitted by Developer for Client's review and approval. **Developer shall provide up to two (2) rounds of revisions at no additional charge; further revisions shall be billed at Developer's standard hourly rate.**

**Rationale:** Prevents unlimited free revision cycles.

---

### Change 4: Add SOW Superseding Structure

**Add to Section 2 or Recitals:**

> Each SOW shall set forth the Services and Deliverables for a defined block of prepaid hours. Upon execution of a new SOW, such SOW shall supersede all prior SOWs with respect to the scope of Services and Deliverables to be performed, except that all terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply. Work items from prior SOWs not completed may be carried forward into a new SOW by mutual agreement.

**Rationale:** Reflects the actual working arrangement already in use between the parties.

---

## Section 3 - Compensation (Page 2)

### Change 5: Insert Complete Compensation Terms

**Current:**
> [Parties to insert description of compensation terms/methodology; invoicing terms; etc.]

**Proposed replacement:**

> **3. Compensation.**
>
> **(a) Hourly Rate.** Client shall compensate Developer at the rate of One Hundred Fifty U.S. Dollars ($150.00 USD) per hour for all Services performed.
>
> **(b) Prepaid Blocks.** Services shall be performed in prepaid blocks of hours. Prior to the commencement of each block, the Parties shall mutually agree on the number of hours in the block, and Client shall prepay for such hours upon receipt of Developer's invoice. Each block shall be accompanied by a Statement of Work describing the intended scope of Services for that block.
>
> **(c) Payment Terms.** All invoices are due and payable upon receipt. Payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars via Wise transfer to Developer's designated Wise account, or by such other method as the Parties may agree in writing.
>
> **(d) Expenses.** Third-party services, hosting, software licenses, and similar project costs shall be paid directly by Client. In the event Developer incurs any project-related expenses (such as API usage charges), Developer shall notify Client and the Parties shall mutually determine responsibility for such costs. Any expenses to be reimbursed to Developer shall be invoiced separately and paid via Wise transfer.
>
> **(e) Rate Adjustment.** Developer's hourly rate may be adjusted upon mutual written agreement of the Parties. Any rate adjustment shall apply to SOWs executed after the date of such agreement.
>
> **(f) Work Stoppage.** If any prepaid block is exhausted and a new block has not been agreed upon and prepaid, Developer shall have no obligation to continue performing Services until a new block is established.

**Rationale:** Formalizes the existing prepaid block arrangement already in use between the parties.

---

## Section 4 - Termination (Page 2)

### Change 6: Make Convenience Termination Mutual

**Current:**
> This Agreement (including any or all SOWs) may also be terminated by Client for its convenience without penalty or termination fee, but only upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to Developer.

**Proposed:**
> This Agreement (including any or all SOWs) may also be terminated by **either Party** for **such Party's** convenience without penalty or termination fee, but only upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to **the other Party**.

**Rationale:** Balances termination rights between the parties.

---

### Change 7: Add Termination Payment/Transition Provisions

**Add to Section 4:**

> Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement:
>
> (i) Client shall pay Developer for all Services performed and expenses incurred through the effective date of termination.
>
> (ii) With respect to prepaid blocks: any unused prepaid hours shall be refunded to Client on a pro-rata basis.
>
> (iii) Developer shall deliver to Client all completed Deliverables and work-in-progress as of the termination date.
>
> (iv) Each Party shall return or destroy the other Party's Confidential Information in accordance with Section 6(c).

**Rationale:** Clarifies what happens to payment and work product upon termination.

---

## Section 5 - Ownership of Deliverables (Pages 2-3)

### Change 8: Limit Further Assurances Obligation

**Current:**
> Developer agrees to execute, and to cause its personnel (if applicable) to execute, such documents and take such actions as Client may reasonably request to perfect, maintain, or enforce Client's rights in the Deliverables.

**Proposed:**
> Developer agrees to execute, and to cause its personnel (if applicable) to execute, such documents and take such actions as Client may reasonably request to perfect, maintain, or enforce Client's rights in the Deliverables. **Client shall provide Developer with reasonable advance notice of any such request, and if such request is made more than six (6) months after termination of this Agreement, Client shall compensate Developer at Developer's then-current hourly rate for time spent responding to such request.**

**Rationale:** Prevents open-ended obligation to sign paperwork years later without compensation.

---

### Change 9: Clarify General Knowledge Exception

**Current (Section 5(d)):**
> Developer shall not use any Client Materials or Deliverables (including the structure, sequence, organization, or unique features thereof) to develop software or services for any third party, nor incorporate any Client Materials or Deliverables into products or services offered to third parties.

**Add to end of Section 5(d):**

> For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5(d) shall restrict Developer's use of general programming skills, knowledge, techniques, or experience gained during the performance of Services, provided that Developer does not use or disclose any Confidential Client Information.

**Rationale:** Protects Developer's ability to continue working as a developer using general knowledge gained.

---

## Section 6 - Confidentiality (Page 3)

### Change 10: Make Confidentiality Mutual

**Add new Section 6(d):**

> **(d) Mutual Confidentiality.** Client shall hold in confidence any confidential business information disclosed by Developer, including Developer's rates, business methods, and information about Developer's other clients. Client shall not disclose such information to third parties without Developer's prior written consent.

**Rationale:** Developer may share sensitive business information that deserves protection.

---

### Change 11: Limit Confidentiality Survival Period

**Current:**
> Developer's obligations pursuant to this Section 6 shall indefinitely survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Engagement Letter.

**Proposed:**
> Developer's obligations pursuant to this Section 6 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Engagement Letter **for a period of three (3) years; provided, however, that obligations with respect to trade secrets shall survive for so long as such information remains a trade secret under applicable law.**

**Rationale:** Indefinite confidentiality is unreasonable. Three years is industry standard. Trade secrets receive separate, longer protection by law.

---

### Change 12: Allow Archival Copy Retention

**Current (Section 6(c)):**
> ...at Client's option, return or destroy all copies of Confidential Client Information and Client Materials, certifying such destruction in writing upon Client's request.

**Add to end of Section 6(c):**

> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer may retain one (1) archival copy of Confidential Client Information solely for legal compliance and dispute resolution purposes, subject to Developer's ongoing confidentiality obligations.

**Rationale:** Protects Developer in case of later disputes about what was delivered or disclosed.

---

## Section 7 - Representations and Warranties (Page 3)

### Change 13: Add Client Warranties

**Add new Section 7(c):**

> **(c) Client Representations and Warranties.** Client represents and warrants that: (i) it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement; (ii) all Client Materials provided to Developer are owned by or properly licensed to Client, and do not infringe any third party's intellectual property rights; and (iii) Client will provide timely feedback, approvals, and decisions as reasonably necessary for Developer to perform the Services.

**Rationale:** Balances warranties between the parties. Client should warrant that materials provided are legitimate.

---

### Change 14: Revise Warranty Period and Terms

**Current (Section 7(b)):**
> For a period of [twenty-four] months following Client's acceptance of the Deliverables, Developer shall, at no additional charge, correct any reproducible defect or nonconformity in the Deliverables reported by Client, provided that such defect or nonconformity is not caused by Client's misuse or unauthorized modification.

**Proposed replacement:**

> For a period of **sixty (60) days** following **Developer's delivery of each Deliverable (or, if applicable, Client's written acceptance thereof)**, Developer shall, at no additional charge, correct any reproducible defect or nonconformity in the Deliverables reported by Client, **subject to the following conditions:**
>
> **(i)** The defect or nonconformity must exist in the Deliverable as delivered by Developer and must not result from: (A) Client's misuse, unauthorized modification, or combination with other software or services not provided by Developer; (B) changes to third-party platforms, APIs, libraries, or services outside Developer's control; (C) modifications made by anyone other than Developer after delivery; or (D) use of the Deliverable in an environment other than that specified by Developer.
>
> **(ii) Client bears the burden of demonstrating** that the reported defect existed in the Deliverable as originally delivered.
>
> **(iii)** Developer's warranty correction obligations under this Section 7(b) shall not exceed **twenty (20) hours** in the aggregate per SOW. Additional correction work beyond this limit shall be billed at Developer's standard hourly rate.
>
> **(iv)** Developer shall have no warranty obligations with respect to any Deliverable that Client has modified or permitted others to modify without Developer's written consent.

**Rationale:** 24 months is excessive for software (industry standard is 30-90 days). Burden of proof should be on Client who controls the environment. Hour cap prevents unlimited free work. Excludes issues from third-party changes.

---

## Section 8 - Intellectual Property Indemnity (Pages 3-4)

### Change 15: Cap Indemnification Liability

**Current:**
> Developer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Client... from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses...

**Add to end of Section 8(a):**

> Developer's aggregate liability under this Section 8 shall not exceed two (2) times the total amounts paid by Client to Developer under this Agreement.

**Rationale:** Unlimited indemnification is unreasonable. Cap at 2x contract value limits exposure while providing meaningful protection to Client.

---

### Change 16: Add Exclusions for Third-Party Components

**Add to Section 8(c):**

> (iii) claims arising from third-party software, libraries, frameworks, or open source components not created by Developer, provided that Developer has used such components in accordance with their applicable licenses; or
>
> (iv) claims arising from Client's specifications or requirements that necessarily result in infringement.

**Rationale:** Developer should not indemnify for open source library issues or Client-mandated design choices.

---

### Change 17: Limit Indemnity Survival Period

**Current:**
> Developer's obligations pursuant to this Section 8 shall indefinitely survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Engagement Letter.

**Proposed:**
> Developer's obligations pursuant to this Section 8 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Engagement Letter **for a period of three (3) years.**

**Rationale:** Indefinite indemnification is unreasonable. Three years allows reasonable time for claims to surface while limiting long-term exposure.

---

### Change 18: Add Mutual Indemnification

**Add new Section 8(e):**

> **(e) Client Indemnification.** Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Developer from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to: (i) any claim that Client Materials infringe any intellectual property right of a third party; (ii) Client's use of the Deliverables in violation of applicable law; or (iii) Client's breach of this Agreement.

**Rationale:** Indemnification should be mutual. If Client provides infringing materials or misuses the deliverables, Client should indemnify Developer.

---

### Change 19: Add Indemnification Procedures

**Add new Section 8(f):**

> **(f) Indemnification Procedures.** The indemnified Party shall: (i) promptly notify the indemnifying Party of any claim; (ii) give the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement; and (iii) provide reasonable cooperation at the indemnifying Party's expense. The indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim in a manner that admits liability or imposes obligations on the indemnified Party without such Party's prior written consent.

**Rationale:** Standard indemnification procedure language protects both parties.

---

## Section 10 - Limitation on Liability (Page 4)

### Change 20: Narrow Exceptions to Liability Cap

**Current (appears twice in 10(a) and 10(b)):**
> Except for liability arising from (a) Developer's intellectual property indemnity obligations, (b) Developer's breach of its confidentiality obligations, or (c) Developer's gross negligence or willful misconduct

**Proposed:**
> Except for liability arising from Developer's gross negligence or willful misconduct

**Rationale:** IP indemnity is now separately capped (Change 15). Confidentiality breach should not have unlimited exposure. Only gross negligence/willful misconduct warrants unlimited liability.

---

### Change 21: Make Liability Limitations Mutual

**Add new Section 10(c):**

> **(c) Mutual Application.** The limitations of liability set forth in this Section 10 shall apply equally to both Parties. In no event shall either Party's aggregate liability to the other Party exceed the total amounts paid or payable by Client to Developer under this Agreement.

**Rationale:** If Developer's liability is capped, Client's should be as well.

---

### Change 22: Make Consequential Damages Waiver Mutual

**Current (Section 10(b)):**
> ...in no event shall Developer be liable for any lost data or content, lost profits, business interruption...

**Proposed:**
> ...in no event shall **either Party** be liable **to the other** for any lost data or content, lost profits, business interruption or for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages...

**Rationale:** Consequential damages waiver should be mutual.

---

## Section 11 - Governing Law and Exclusive Venue (Page 4)

### Change 23: Replace Litigation with Arbitration

**Current:**
> The Engagement Letter shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles. Any controversy, claim or dispute between the Parties relating to the Engagement Letter or the Services shall be heard in any court of competent jurisdiction situated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

**Proposed replacement:**

> **11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.**
>
> **(a) Governing Law.** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles.
>
> **(b) Informal Resolution.** Before initiating any formal dispute resolution, the Parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation. Either Party may initiate informal negotiations by providing written notice to the other Party describing the dispute. The Parties shall meet (in person or by video conference) within fourteen (14) days of such notice to attempt resolution.
>
> **(c) Arbitration.** Any dispute not resolved through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the Parties, or if the Parties cannot agree, selected by the AAA. The arbitration may be conducted remotely by video conference. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
>
> **(d) Costs.** Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs in any dispute resolution proceeding, and the Parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.
>
> **(e) Small Claims Exception.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may bring an action in small claims court for disputes within the jurisdictional limits of such court.

**Rationale:** Arbitration is faster, cheaper, and can be conducted remotely. More practical for cross-border disputes between Canadian corporation and U.S. client. Louisiana law retained as governing law.

---

## Section 12 - General Provisions (Pages 4-5)

### Change 24: Add No Personal Liability Clause

**Add new Section 12(e):**

> **(e) No Personal Liability.** Fraser Gorrie is signing this Agreement solely in his capacity as an officer and employee of The Technifar Corporation. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impose any personal liability on Fraser Gorrie individually, and Client agrees to look solely to The Technifar Corporation for performance of Developer's obligations hereunder.

**Rationale:** Makes explicit that individual representative is not personally liable.

---

### Change 25: Add Independent Contractor Clause

**Add new Section 12(f):**

> **(f) Independent Contractor.** Developer is an independent contractor and not an employee, partner, or joint venturer of Client. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create an employment, agency, or partnership relationship. Developer shall be solely responsible for all taxes, withholdings, and other statutory obligations related to Developer's compensation.

**Rationale:** Clarifies employment status for tax and liability purposes.

---

### Change 26: Add Assignment Clause

**Add new Section 12(g):**

> **(g) Assignment.** Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that Client may assign this Agreement to any successor entity in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of Client's assets, upon written notice to Developer.

**Rationale:** Prevents unauthorized transfer while permitting Client to assign in acquisition scenario (supporting investor goals).

---

### Change 27: Add Severability Clause

**Add new Section 12(h):**

> **(h) Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, and the invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

**Rationale:** Standard protective clause ensuring one invalid provision doesn't void entire agreement.

---

### Change 28: Add Waiver Clause

**Add new Section 12(i):**

> **(i) Waiver.** The failure of either Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such Party's right to enforce such provision or any other provision in the future.

**Rationale:** Standard clause preventing waiver by non-enforcement.

---

### Change 29: Add Non-Competition Clause

**Add new Section 12(j):**

> **(j) Non-Competition.** During the term of this Agreement and for a period of two (2) years following its termination, Developer agrees not to: (i) develop, design, or build a software application that directly competes with PeerLoop's core functionality as an online peer-based educational platform; (ii) use any Confidential Client Information, Client Materials, or Deliverables to create a competing product; or (iii) solicit or encourage any of Client's users, customers, or course creators to use a competing platform. This restriction shall not prevent Developer from providing general web development services to other clients in the education sector, provided such services do not involve creating a direct competitor to PeerLoop.

**Rationale:** Developer offers this provision to demonstrate good faith and support Client's investor goals.

---

### Change 30: Add Change of Control Provision

**Add new Section 12(k):**

> **(k) Change of Control.** The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement reflects a working relationship based on mutual trust between Developer and Brian LeBlanc personally. In the event of a Change of Control of Client, Developer shall have the right, exercisable within sixty (60) days of receiving written notice of such Change of Control, to either: (i) terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' written notice without penalty; or (ii) request renegotiation of the terms of this Agreement, in which case the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. If renegotiation is requested but the Parties are unable to reach agreement within such period, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice. For purposes of this Section, "Change of Control" means: (A) the sale or transfer of more than forty-nine percent (49%) of the ownership interests in Client; (B) a merger, consolidation, or similar transaction in which Brian LeBlanc ceases to control the day-to-day operations of Client; or (C) the sale of all or substantially all of Client's assets.

**Rationale:** Acknowledges the personal nature of the working relationship while supporting Client's ability to pursue investors and acquisition.

---

## New Sections to Add

### New Section 13 - Notices

> **13. Notices.** All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by email to the addresses set forth below (or to such other address as a Party may designate by notice):
>
> **If to Client:**
> Brian LeBlanc
> [Address]
> Email: [email address]
>
> **If to Developer:**
> The Technifar Corporation
> Attn: Fraser Gorrie
> [Address]
> Email: [email address]
>
> Notices sent by email shall be deemed received upon confirmation of receipt by reply email, read receipt, or other reasonable evidence of delivery. Either Party may update its notice address by providing written notice to the other Party.

**Rationale:** Agreement requires written notice but provides no addresses. Email notification is practical for this working relationship.

---

### New Section 14 - Client Cooperation

> **14. Client Cooperation.** Client acknowledges that Developer's ability to perform the Services depends on Client's timely cooperation. Client agrees to:
>
> **(a)** Provide timely access to Client Materials, systems, accounts, and personnel reasonably necessary for Developer to perform the Services;
>
> **(b)** Respond to Developer's requests for information, feedback, or approval within five (5) business days, unless a different timeframe is agreed;
>
> **(c)** Designate a primary point of contact authorized to make decisions on Client's behalf; and
>
> **(d)** Notify Developer promptly of any changes to project requirements or priorities.
>
> If Client's failure to cooperate causes delays in Developer's performance, any affected deadlines shall be extended by a reasonable period, and Developer shall not be liable for such delays.

**Rationale:** Establishes Client's responsibilities and protects Developer from being blamed for Client-caused delays.

---

### New Section 15 - Portfolio Rights

> **15. Portfolio Rights.** Upon completion of the project or with Client's prior written consent, Developer may include a general description of the Services performed and non-confidential screenshots or descriptions of the Deliverables in Developer's portfolio, website, and marketing materials for the purpose of showcasing Developer's work to prospective clients. Developer shall not disclose Confidential Client Information in such materials without Client's prior written approval.

**Rationale:** Allows Developer to reference work for future business development while respecting confidentiality.

---

### New Section 16 - Force Majeure

> **16. Force Majeure.** Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, epidemics, pandemics, government actions, power failures, internet or telecommunications failures, or failures of third-party service providers. The affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party and use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the force majeure event.

**Rationale:** Standard clause protecting both parties from liability for events outside their control.

---

>
> **DELIVERABLES**
>
> **1. Overall Project Goal**
>
> The ultimate deliverable under this Agreement is a minimum viable product ("MVP") web application for "PeerLoop," an online peer-based educational platform. The MVP will enable course creators to publish educational content and learners to engage with that content in a peer-supported environment.

>
> The Parties acknowledge that PeerLoop is in early-stage development and that the specific features, functionality, and technical implementation of the MVP cannot be fully defined at the outset. Accordingly:
>
> **(a)** The Deliverables shall be developed iteratively through a series of prepaid blocks of hours ("Blocks"), each accompanied by a Statement of Work ("SOW").
>
> **(b)** Each SOW shall describe the intended Deliverables for that Block based on the project's status at the time of SOW creation.
>
> **(c)** Upon completion of each Block, the Parties shall evaluate progress and mutually agree on the scope of the next SOW. Features, priorities, and technical approaches may be adjusted based on learnings from prior Blocks.
>
> **(d)** A preliminary Block structure through MVP completion has been outlined by Client and Client's advisor; however, this structure is a planning guide only and will evolve as the project progresses.
>
> **3. MVP Acceptance Criteria**
>
> The MVP shall be deemed complete when the Parties mutually agree in writing that:
>
> **(a)** Core platform functionality has been implemented sufficient for initial user testing and investor demonstration;
>
> **(b)** The application is deployable to a production environment; and
>
> **(c)** Client has accepted the final SOW deliverables in accordance with Section 2 of the Agreement.
>
> **4. Current SOW Reference**
>
> The specific Deliverables currently in progress are set forth in the most recent SOW executed by the Parties, which is incorporated herein by reference.
>
> ---

---

## Exhibit B - Services

> **EXHIBIT B**
>
> **SERVICES**
>
> **1. Scope of Services**

>
> **(e) Documentation**: Providing technical documentation reasonably necessary for Client to understand, maintain, and operate the Deliverables.
>
> **2. Block and SOW Structure**
>
> Services shall be performed in sequential Blocks as follows:
>
> **(a)** Prior to each Block, the Parties shall execute a SOW describing the intended Services and Deliverables for that Block.
>
> **(b)** Each SOW represents the Parties' good-faith estimate of what can be accomplished within the Block's prepaid hours. Actual progress may vary based on technical complexity, changing requirements, or unforeseen challenges.
>
> **(c)** Upon execution of a new SOW, such SOW shall supersede all prior SOWs with respect to the scope of Services and Deliverables to be performed, except that all terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply.
>
> **(d)** Work items from prior SOWs not completed may be carried forward into a new SOW by mutual agreement.
>
> **(e)** Either Party may propose adjustments to tasks, priorities, or deliverables during a Block; such adjustments shall be documented in the subsequent SOW.
>
> **3. Preliminary Block Structure**
>
> The Parties have discussed a preliminary Block structure to guide planning through MVP completion. This structure is provided for reference only and shall be refined through successive SOWs:
>
> | Block | Focus Area | Status |
> |-------|------------|--------|
> | 1 | Project setup, tech stack, initial architecture | Completed |
> | 2 | [To be defined in SOW] | Pending |
> | 3+ | [Subsequent Blocks to be defined based on progress] | Future |
>
> *Note: Block count, scope, and sequencing will evolve based on project progress and changing priorities.*
>
> **4. Current SOW Reference**
>
> The specific Services currently being performed are set forth in the most recent SOW executed by the Parties, which is incorporated herein by reference.
