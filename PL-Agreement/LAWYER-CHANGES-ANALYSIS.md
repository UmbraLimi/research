## Change 1: Section 2 - Timeline Reference

**Lawyer changed:**
> "...in accordance with the applicable terms of **this Agreement, if applicable, and** the applicable SOW."

**What this means:** Timelines can come from either the main Agreement OR from individual SOWs.

**Impact:** Neutral. Adds flexibility for where timelines are defined.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 2: Section 2 - Revisions Consume Block Hours

**Lawyer added:**
> "All such revisions shall become part of the current SOW and **expend its block hours**."

**What this means:** If Brian asks for revisions, those revisions use up hours from the current prepaid block - they're not free.

**Impact:** FAVORABLE to Developer. You get paid for revision work.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 3: Section 3(b) - Terminology Change

**Lawyer changed:**
> "Each block shall be accompanied by ~~a Statement of Work~~**an SOW**"

**What this means:** Just using the defined abbreviation consistently.

**Impact:** None - purely editorial.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 4: Section 3(d) - Expenses Restructured

**Original language (struck):**
> "In the event Developer incurs any project-related expenses (such as API usage charges), Developer shall notify Client and the Parties shall mutually determine responsibility for such costs."

**Lawyer's replacement:**
> "Third-party services, hosting, software licenses, and similar project costs shall be **identified by Developer in each SOW, if applicable, and shall be** paid directly by Client. Any expenses to be reimbursed to Developer **(e.g., any project-related expenses (such as API usage charges)) shall be identified by Developer in each SOW, if applicable,** shall be invoiced separately and paid via Wise transfer."

**What this means:** Instead of notifying Brian AFTER incurring expenses, you must identify anticipated expenses in each SOW BEFORE incurring them.

**Impact:** More administrative burden on Developer. You need to forecast expenses in advance.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 5: Section 4(a) - Termination Convenience (Accepted but Caveated)

**Your proposal was accepted:** Changed "Client" to "either Party" for convenience termination.

**But lawyer added caveat:**
> "provided, however, **Developer may not terminate any SOWs that are then in progress for convenience without Client's written agreement thereto.**"

**What this means:** You can terminate the overall Agreement for convenience, but you can't walk away from a SOW that's in progress without Brian's agreement.

**Impact:** Limits your mid-SOW exit flexibility. If you've accepted payment for a block, you're committed to complete that block.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 6: Section 5(d) - General Knowledge Exception (Extended)

**Your proposal was accepted, but lawyer added:**
> "...provided that Developer does not use or disclose any Confidential Client Information **or Client Materials.**"

**What this means:** The carve-out for general skills is slightly narrower - you can't use Client Materials in addition to Confidential Information.

**Impact:** Minor tightening. Consistent with other provisions that protect Client Materials.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 7: Section 7(b) - Warranty Work Now Billable

**Original concept:** Free bug fixes for a warranty period

**Lawyer's revision:**
> "Developer shall correct any reproducible defect or nonconformity in the Deliverable reported by Client **through a subsequent block of hours with an appropriate SOW.**"

**What this means:** Warranty corrections are done as paid work through a new SOW, not as free work.

**Impact:** VERY FAVORABLE to Developer. You get paid for bug fixes instead of providing them free.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 8: Section 8(a) - Indemnity Cap Exception Added

**Your 2x cap was accepted, but lawyer added:**
> "**Absent Developer's gross negligence or willful misconduct,** Developer's aggregate liability under this Section 8 shall not exceed two (2) times the total amounts paid..."

**What this means:** The 2x cap doesn't apply if you're grossly negligent or act with willful misconduct. In those cases, liability could be unlimited.

**Impact:** Reasonable. Standard to exclude intentional bad acts from caps. You wouldn't be grossly negligent.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 9: Section 8(c)(iii) - Third-Party Components Wording

**Your proposal:**
> "claims arising from third-party software..."

**Lawyer's revision:**
> "**Developer's utilization of** third-party software, libraries, frameworks, or open source components not created by Developer, provided that Developer has used such components in accordance with their applicable licenses"

**What this means:** Clarifies this is about YOUR USE of third-party components (not just their existence). You must follow the licenses.

**Impact:** Slightly more specific. You need to follow open source licenses (which you do anyway).

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 10: Section 8(c)(iv) - Client Specification Wording

**Your proposal:**
> "claims arising from Client's specifications..."

**Lawyer's revision:**
> "**Developer's compliance with** Client's specifications or requirements that necessarily result in infringement."

**What this means:** Reframes to emphasize you were following their instructions.

**Impact:** Neutral - same practical effect.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 11: Section 8(e) - Client Breach Indemnity Removed

**Your proposal included:**
> "Client shall defend, indemnify... arising out of or relating to: (i)... (ii)... or (iii) Client's breach of this Agreement."

**Lawyer struck:**
> "~~or (iii) Client's breach of this Agreement.~~"

**What this means:** Client will NOT indemnify you for claims arising from their breach of the Agreement.

**Impact:** Less protection for Developer. If Brian breaches the agreement and you get sued as a result, he doesn't have to indemnify you.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 12: Section 8(f) - Indemnification Procedures (Replaced)

**Your simpler version (struck):**
> "The indemnified Party shall: (i) promptly notify the indemnifying Party of any claim; (ii) give the indemnifying Party sole control of the defense and settlement; and (iii) provide reasonable cooperation at the indemnifying Party's expense. The indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim in a manner that admits liability or imposes obligations on the indemnified Party without such Party's prior written consent."

**Lawyer's detailed replacement:**
A much longer provision with:
- 5 business day notice requirement
- Indemnifying party can defend and settle (with indemnified party's consent for settlement)
- Indemnified party can approve legal counsel
- Indemnified party can participate in defense (at their own cost)
- If indemnifying party doesn't respond in 15 business days, indemnified party can take over defense at indemnifying party's expense

**What this means:** More detailed procedures. Actually gives MORE rights to the indemnified party (can approve counsel, can participate).

**Impact:** More complex but arguably MORE protective of both parties.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 13: Section 10(c) - Gross Negligence Exception Added

**Lawyer added to mutual liability cap:**
> "**Absent Developer's gross negligence or willful misconduct,** in no event shall either Party's aggregate liability to the other Party exceed..."

**What this means:** Consistent with Change 8 - gross negligence/willful misconduct is excluded from the cap.

**Impact:** Reasonable consistency.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 14: Section 11(c) - ARBITRATION REJECTED

**Your proposal:** Binding arbitration via AAA, can be conducted remotely by video conference.

**Lawyer's revision:** Struck ALL arbitration language. Changed heading from "Arbitration" to "Exclusive Venue."

**New text:**
> "Any dispute not resolved through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days shall be **heard in any court of competent jurisdiction situated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.**"

**What this means:** If there's a legal dispute, it must be litigated in Louisiana courts, not resolved through arbitration.

**Impact:** SIGNIFICANT for Developer. You would have to:
- Hire Louisiana counsel
- Potentially travel to Louisiana
- Deal with U.S. court procedures
- Face higher costs than arbitration

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 15: Section 11(d) - Arbitrator Fees Removed

**Lawyer struck:**
> "~~and the Parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.~~"

**What this means:** No longer relevant since arbitration was rejected.

**Impact:** N/A - follows from Change 14.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 16: Section 11(e) - Injunctive Relief Exception Added

**Original:** Only small claims exception

**Lawyer's revision:**
> "**Exceptions.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may **(i)** bring an action in small claims court... **and (ii) bring an action for equitable or injunctive relief without first complying with the foregoing terms of this Section 11.**"

**What this means:** Either party can go directly to court (without informal resolution first) to seek emergency injunctions - e.g., to stop disclosure of confidential information.

**Impact:** Standard provision. Protects both parties' ability to seek emergency relief.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 17: Section 12(j) - Non-Compete Period REMOVED

**Your proposal:** 2-year post-termination non-compete

**Lawyer's revision:**
> "During the term of this Agreement ~~and for a period of two (2) years following its termination~~**and thereafter, and without limitation of Developer's other obligations hereunder**, Developer agrees not to..."

**What this means:** The hard 2-year post-termination restriction is GONE. The non-compete now only applies:
1. During the Agreement term, AND
2. "Thereafter" only as it relates to your "other obligations" (i.e., the 3-year confidentiality period)

**Impact:** VERY FAVORABLE to Developer. Much shorter restriction period.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 18: Section 12(j) - PeerLoop → Client

**Lawyer changed:**
> "...directly competes with ~~PeerLoop's~~**Client's** core functionality..."
> "...direct competitor to ~~PeerLoop~~**Client**."

**What this means:** Uses defined term "Client" instead of product name "PeerLoop."

**Impact:** Technically broader (covers any platform Client develops), but practically the same.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 19: Section 13 - Email Address Added

**Lawyer added:**
> "If to Client: Brian LeBlanc: Email: ~~[email address]~~**bjleblanc@gmail.com**"

**What this means:** Brian's actual email is now specified.

**Impact:** Good - makes the notice provision functional.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 20: Section 14 - Client Cooperation Restructured

**Lawyer restructured the list from (a)/(b)/(c)/(d) to (i)/(ii)/(iii)/(iv) format.**

**What this means:** Formatting change only.

**Impact:** None - purely editorial.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 21: Section 14 - Response Timeline REMOVED

**Your proposal:**
> "Respond to Developer's requests for information, feedback, or approval **within five (5) business days, unless a different timeframe is agreed**"

**Lawyer struck the timeline:**
> "timely respond to Developer's requests for information, feedback, or approval~~within five (5) business days, unless a different timeframe is agreed~~"

**What this means:** No specific deadline for Brian to respond. Just "timely" (undefined).

**Impact:** Less protection for Developer. You can't point to a contractual deadline if Brian is slow to respond.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 22: Section 14 - Brian as Default Contact

**Lawyer added:**
> "designate a primary point of contact authorized to make decisions on Client's behalf**; (it being understood and agreed that Brian LeBlanc shall serve as such point of contact unless and until Client otherwise notifies Developer**"

**What this means:** Brian is explicitly named as the default decision-maker.

**Impact:** Helpful clarity. You know who has authority.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 23: Section 15 - Portfolio Rights Now Requires Prior Consent

**Your proposal:**
> "**Upon completion of the project or with** Client's prior written consent, Developer may include..."

**Lawyer's revision:**
> "**With** Client's prior written consent, Developer may include..."

**What this means:** You can ONLY use project materials in your portfolio with Brian's prior written consent. No automatic right after project completion.

**Impact:** Restricts Developer. You need permission every time, even after the project is done.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 24: Section 15 - Client Materials Added

**Lawyer added:**
> "Developer shall not disclose Confidential Client Information **or Client Materials** in such materials without Client's prior written approval."

**What this means:** Can't include Client Materials in portfolio without permission (in addition to confidential info).

**Impact:** Consistent with broader Client Materials protections. Reasonable.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]

---

## Change 25: Signature Page - First Amendment → Agreement

**Lawyer changed:**
> "...have executed this ~~First Amendment~~**Agreement** as of the date..."

**What this means:** This is the original agreement, not an amendment.

**Impact:** Correct - this is the initial agreement, not an amendment.

**Your response:** [TO DISCUSS]
