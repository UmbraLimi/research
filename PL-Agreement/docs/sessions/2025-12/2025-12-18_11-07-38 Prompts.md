## Prompts (in sequence)

1. **Create Exhibit content with flexible Block/SOW structure:**
   > Exhibit A and B need to have some general information about Blocks and SOWs being created sequentially with adjustments to tasks and deliverables as we go. The Deliverable is an MVP web application but its final features are not known at this time. The Client and his advisor have come up with a potential Block structure all the way to the MVP, but this structure will evolve with the results of each block's progress. I need you, Claude Code, to take this idea mix in what you know from @../FACTS.md and create a starting entry for both Exhibit A and B.

2. **Sync related document:**
   > We need to update @../REDLINES.md

3. **Document file relationships and update triggers:**
   > @../CLAUDE.md should explain the roles and relatedness of all the files we have. So that a change in FACTS, REDLINES or PROPOSED-CHANGES-YYYY-MM-DD-A will trigger a check on whether the other files need updating. Can you confirm?

4. `/gr-end-session`

5. **Feedback on missed work:**
   > You missed the changes from the last prompt I gave, which at least would have necessitated a /gr-prompts and probably the others too

## Notable Prompts

**Prompt #3** is particularly reusable - it establishes a pattern for any project with interconnected documentation files where changes to one should trigger review of others.
