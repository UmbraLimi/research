# Session Learnings - 2025-12-18

## Contract Analysis Workflow

### Process Learnings

1. **One question at a time is more effective** - User preferred iterative Q&A over a wall of questions. Reduces cognitive load and ensures thorough answers.

2. **Maintain a FACTS.md document** - Capturing facts and context in a living document enables session continuity and prevents re-asking questions.

3. **Separate documents for different audiences** - REDLINES.md (detailed analysis for developer) vs PROPOSED-CHANGES.md (clean format for lawyer) serve different purposes.

4. **Version naming convention** - Using `YYYY-MM-DD-A/B/C` suffix allows tracking back-and-forth negotiations even on the same day.

### Contract Analysis Learnings

5. **Indefinite survival clauses vary in fairness:**
   - IP ownership: Indefinite is standard and fair (ownership is permanent)
   - Confidentiality: Indefinite is NOT standard; 3-5 years is industry norm
   - Indemnification: Indefinite is NOT standard; should be time-limited

6. **Liability cap exceptions can swallow the cap** - A cap with broad exceptions (IP indemnity, confidentiality, gross negligence) provides little actual protection. Narrow exceptions to only gross negligence/willful misconduct.

7. **Work-for-hire warranties** - 24 months is excessive for software; 30-90 days is industry standard. Burden of proof matters: should be on party who controls the environment.

8. **Cross-border considerations matter:**
   - Canadian corp + US client + Louisiana law = jurisdiction complexity
   - Arbitration (remote) is more practical than foreign litigation
   - "Work for hire" doctrine may differ across jurisdictions

9. **Prepaid block model provides natural protection** - Developer is paid in advance, reducing non-payment risk. Makes termination clauses less critical.

10. **Non-compete as good faith gesture** - Offering a reasonable non-compete demonstrates good faith and supports client's investor goals while protecting developer's ability to work.

### Negotiation Strategy Learnings

11. **Categorize changes by priority:**
    - Must-Have (7): Dealbreakers - don't sign without
    - Important (11): Push hard, negotiate specifics
    - Nice-to-Have (16): Concede to show flexibility

12. **Know your leverage:**
    - Existing relationship and trust
    - Knowledge of the project (5 weeks invested)
    - Good faith gestures already being made
    - Industry-standard requests, not unusual demands

13. **Frame for the audience:**
    - For client: "This supports your investor goals"
    - For lawyer: Clean section-by-section format
    - For self: Detailed rationale and negotiation room

## Technical Learnings

14. **PDF reading works well** - Claude Code can read PDFs and extract text for analysis.

15. **Document conversion workflow** - User without Word can request Google Doc access or create lawyer-friendly markdown that can be converted to PDF.
