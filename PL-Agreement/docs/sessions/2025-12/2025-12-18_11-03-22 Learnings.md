## Documentation Structure

- **Interconnected document pattern**: For legal/agreement analysis projects, maintain three related files:
  - `FACTS.md` - Source of truth for context (parties, timeline, terms, concerns)
  - `REDLINES.md` - Working document with analysis, proposed changes, rationale, and negotiation strategy
  - `PROPOSED-CHANGES-*.md` - Clean presentation version for sharing with counterparty

- **Dependency flow**: FACTS → REDLINES → PROPOSED-CHANGES. Changes to upstream files should trigger review of downstream files.

- **Version naming**: Use `PROPOSED-CHANGES-YYYY-MM-DD-A.md` format with letter suffix (A, B, C) for same-day revisions.

## Contract Exhibits

- **Flexible Exhibit structure**: When deliverables and services cannot be fully defined upfront (common in software development), Exhibits should:
  - State the overall goal (e.g., MVP web application)
  - Acknowledge the iterative nature explicitly
  - Reference the Block/SOW structure for detailed scope
  - Include acceptance criteria that allow for evolution
  - Point to "current SOW" rather than trying to enumerate all features

- **Block/SOW language**: Key concepts to capture:
  - Each SOW supersedes prior SOWs for scope
  - Work items can carry forward by mutual agreement
  - Either party can propose adjustments during a Block
  - Preliminary Block structure is a planning guide, not a commitment

## Workflow

- **Keep documents in sync**: When adding content to PROPOSED-CHANGES, immediately update REDLINES (and vice versa). Summary statistics should match in both files.

- **CLAUDE.md update triggers**: Document file relationships and update triggers in project CLAUDE.md so future sessions know to check related files when one changes.

- **When user says "update X"**: After updating one file, proactively check if related files need the same update. Don't wait for user to ask for each file separately.

## CLAUDE.md Best Practice

- **Document file relationships explicitly**: For projects with interconnected files, add a "Project Files and Relationships" section to CLAUDE.md that:
  - Lists each file with its purpose
  - Shows dependency flow (which files inform which)
  - Specifies update triggers (what changes in file A mean for files B and C)
  - This ensures Claude checks related files when any one is modified
