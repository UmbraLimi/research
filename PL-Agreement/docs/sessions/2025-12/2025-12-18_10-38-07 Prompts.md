# Session Prompts - 2025-12-18

## Contract Analysis Session

### Setup & Context

1. "I want you to update the local CLAUDE.md file (not the one in the parent folder) for the following: The purpose of this folder is to examine the agreement PDF file and suggest changes and assess concerns, and generally explain what the intent of the letter might be. The letter comes from a lawyer on behalf of his Client Brian who is currently paying me to develop his web application Peer Loop (formerly called Alpha Peer). We have no written agreement at this time and this one is to be that agreement. Brian has expressed to me that he wants to ensure that there are no hurdles to him getting investors (who will want some ownership in the business and/or software I am developing). His lawyer has crafted this agreement from his perspective. I do not have a lawyer (yet) but I want to do the 'broad strokes' of my own due diligence by making changes to this document. Your role is to safeguard me from foreseeable issues based on what is included in this document now, and equally importantly, what is missing from this document that would safeguard and/or benefit me."

2. "Please read the letter and ask your questions about me or the project to help you in our goal"

3. "Let's make a PLAN.md of these questions and the outcomes we are looking for"

### Information Gathering (Phase 1)

4. "I'm ready. Let's start. Please ask the question again"

5. "Can we do these one at a time? I find a wall of questions and constantly scrolling up and down to see what has scrolled by tedious and counterproductive"

6. [User answered questions 1-13 one at a time with detailed context about their situation, payment history, business entity, concerns, etc.]

### Analysis (Phase 2)

7. "yes start phase 2 analysis"

8. "As long as I cannot be personally sued then I suppose things can be left as is. I would prefer that you specify that I am acting as an employee somehow"

9. "Yes" [to tracking changes in separate document]

10. "yes continue to section 2" [repeated for each section through section 12]

### Specific Decisions

11. "2" [choosing option 2 for late payment - remove clause given good relationship]

12. "2" [choosing option 2 for termination refund - pro-rata for all terminations]

### Concern #6 Discussion

13. "yes address concerns 6 and 11. For Concern 6, I want to make it plain that I am not going to inhibit the potential to gain investors (who will have needs) or purchasers (who too will have needs). I guess I want the right to stop working on the project once any of those things happen. Let's discuss"

14. [Detailed answers about non-compete scope, ownership threshold preferences]
    - "1. option - all of your options"
    - "2. I want the option to leave no matter what. It is unlikely if Brian is still involved"
    - "3. both b and c"
    - "4. I suppose I have the right to exit at any time... but on change in ownership, when adding partners, then I want to be able to say I am not going to continue, but if I do continue, then new terms will need to be negotiated..."

15. "1. looks great" / "2. > 49% is better" [finalizing non-compete and change of control details]

### Wrap-up

16. "Yes!" [to creating prioritized negotiation guide]

17. "is there anything left in the PLAN?"

18. "I know these changes will quickly be forwarded on to his lawyer, as Brian has no interest in legalese (he has said so). The original document was a .doc file. How can I minimize the effort of his lawyer without editing the .doc file (I do not have Microsoft Word access)?"

19. "Yes!" [to creating PROPOSED-CHANGES.md for lawyer]

20. "Rename the REQUESTED-CHANGES.md to have the today's date appended plus the letter 'A' so that we can handle any back and forth with the lawyer even on the same day"

21. "I think the lawyer might move the changes into their original .doc file and send that. Will you be able to work with that (after I turn that .doc into a pdf)?"

22. "Will do"

## Notable Prompt Patterns

- **Iterative Q&A request:** "Can we do these one at a time?" - Improved workflow significantly
- **Context-setting prompt:** Initial CLAUDE.md update provided comprehensive background
- **Decision-making:** Simple numbered options with brief responses ("2", "Yes", etc.)
- **Forward-thinking:** Versioning request and asking about future workflow with lawyer responses
