**Re:** Alpha Peer Engagement Letter - Response to 12.29.25 Draft

Brian,

Thank you for sending the revised agreement. I've reviewed the changes carefully and am pleased with the overall direction. The lawyer addressed the vast majority of my proposed changes, and I appreciate the collaborative approach.

I'm prepared to sign with just **two modifications** and **one clarification**:

---

## 1. Section 11 - Dispute Resolution (Proposed Modification)

I understand the preference for Louisiana courts over arbitration, and I'm willing to accept that. However, as an Ontario-based contractor, I'd like two additions to protect both parties from frivolous litigation and reduce practical burdens:

1. **Prevailing party recovers attorney's fees** - This discourages weak claims from either side
2. **Remote proceedings where permitted** - Reduces travel burden while respecting Louisiana venue

### Current Language (12.29.25 Draft):

> **(c) Exclusive Venue.** Any dispute not resolved through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days shall be heard in any court of competent jurisdiction situated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
>
> **(d) Costs.** Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs in any dispute resolution proceeding.
>
> **(e) Exceptions.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may (i) bring an action in small claims court for disputes within the jurisdictional limits of such court, and (ii) bring an action for equitable or injunctive relief without first complying with the foregoing terms of this Section 11.

### Proposed Language:

> **(c) Exclusive Venue.** Any dispute not resolved through informal negotiation within thirty (30) days shall be heard in any court of competent jurisdiction situated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. **To the extent permitted by applicable rules and the court, proceedings may be conducted remotely by video conference.**
>
> **(d) Costs.** Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs in any dispute resolution proceeding**; provided, however, that the prevailing Party in any litigation shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party.**
>
> **(e) Exceptions.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may (i) bring an action in small claims court for disputes within the jurisdictional limits of such court, and (ii) bring an action for equitable or injunctive relief without first complying with the foregoing terms of this Section 11.

## 2. Section 12(j) - Non-Competition (Clarification Needed)

I have a question about the intended duration of the non-compete restriction. The current language uses "thereafter" without specifying an end date, which could be interpreted as indefinite.

### Current Language (12.29.25 Draft):

> **(j) Non-Competition.** During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, and without limitation of Developer's other obligations hereunder, Developer agrees not to: (i) develop, design, or build a software application that directly competes with Client's core functionality as an online peer-based educational platform; (ii) use any Confidential Client Information, Client Materials, or Deliverables to create a competing product; or (iii) solicit or encourage any of Client's users, customers, or course creators to use a competing platform. This restriction shall not prevent Developer from providing general web development services to other clients in the education sector, provided such services do not involve creating a direct competitor to Client.

### My Question:

What is the intended duration of "thereafter"?

**Possible interpretations:**
- **Indefinite** (potentially forever)
- **Tied to related obligations** (e.g., the 3-year confidentiality survival period)
- **A specific period** (e.g., 2 years, as I originally proposed)

I'm comfortable with a defined period (2-3 years post-termination), but I'd like clarity on the intended scope before signing. If indefinite is intended, I'd like to discuss limiting this to a specific term.

### If a Defined Period is Acceptable, Proposed Language:

> **(j) Non-Competition.** During the term of this Agreement **and for a period of two (2) years following its termination**, Developer agrees not to: (i) develop, design, or build a software application that directly competes with Client's core functionality as an online peer-based educational platform; (ii) use any Confidential Client Information, Client Materials, or Deliverables to create a competing product; or (iii) solicit or encourage any of Client's users, customers, or course creators to use a competing platform. This restriction shall not prevent Developer from providing general web development services to other clients in the education sector, provided such services do not involve creating a direct competitor to Client.

## 3. Section 13 - Notices (Minor Edit)

Please update my email address to remove the brackets:

### Current:
> If to Developer: The Technifar Corporation Attn: Fraser Gorrie Email: [fraser@meristics.com]

### Corrected:
> If to Developer: The Technifar Corporation Attn: Fraser Gorrie Email: fraser@meristics.com

## Summary

| Item | Section | Action Requested |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Dispute Resolution | 11(c)-(d) | Add prevailing party fees + remote proceedings |
| Non-Competition | 12(j) | Clarify duration of "thereafter" |
| Notice Address | 13 | Remove brackets from email |

All other changes in the 12.29.25 draft are acceptable.

I'm hopeful we can resolve these items quickly and get the agreement signed. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any of these points.
