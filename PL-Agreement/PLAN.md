## Phase 3: Deliverables

### Outputs

1. **Concerns Document**: ✅ FACTS.md - 11 concerns documented and addressed
2. **Missing Protections**: ✅ REDLINES.md - 4 missing provisions identified and drafted
3. **Suggested Redlines**: ✅ REDLINES.md - 30 changes + 4 additions = 34 total modifications
4. **Questions for Lawyer**: See below

### Items for Professional Legal Review

Before signing, a lawyer should review:

1. **Cross-border enforceability** - Canadian corporation, US client, Louisiana law - are all provisions enforceable?
2. **Arbitration clause** - Is AAA arbitration appropriate for Canada-US disputes?
3. **Non-compete scope** - Is "peer-based educational platform" sufficiently narrow?
4. **Change of Control trigger** - Is >49% the right threshold?
5. **Tax implications** - Any withholding or reporting requirements for US-Canada payments?
6. **IP assignment** - Does "work for hire" doctrine apply to Canadian entities under Louisiana law?
