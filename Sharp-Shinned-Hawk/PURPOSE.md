## Goals

Write a detailed, personal account of the sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus) that:
- Combines scientific accuracy with engaging storytelling
- Appeals to a broad audience (ages 18-85) without dumbing down the content
- Includes personal anecdotes that bring the species to life
- Gets published across multiple platforms in tailored formats

This isn't a field guide entry—it's a love letter to a bird that most people overlook or mistake for something else.

---

## Background Information

- Years of backyard birding observations, including multiple sharp-shinned sightings at feeders
- Photos I've taken (varying quality)
- Cornell Lab of Ornithology resources (All About Birds, eBird data)
- Field guides: Sibley, Peterson, Kaufman
- Personal journal entries from memorable encounters
- Knowledge of the Cooper's Hawk confusion (the eternal ID challenge)

---

## Personal Context

- I'm a hobbyist birder, not a professional ornithologist
- Writing is something I enjoy but I'm not prolific—this project needs structure
- I have a blog, Twitter account, and Substack already set up
- Time is limited; I work on projects like this in evenings and weekends
- I want this to be a template for future species accounts if it goes well

## Content & Sources

**Anecdotes to potentially include:**
1. The first time I correctly distinguished a sharpie from a Cooper's (the "aha" moment)
2. Watching a sharp-shinned hunt at my feeder—the chaos, the speed, the aftermath
3. The time I found a sharp-shinned stunned after hitting a window (rehabilitation story)
4. Migration day when dozens passed overhead at a hawk watch site
5. Explaining to a non-birder neighbor why I was excited about a "small hawk"

**Topics to cover:**
- Physical description and field marks
- Hunting behavior and diet
- Sharp-shinned vs. Cooper's Hawk identification
- Migration patterns
- Backyard encounters and feeder dynamics

## Concerns & Risks

- Balancing "personal" with "informative"—too personal and it's navel-gazing, too dry and it's Wikipedia
- Reaching such a broad age range without being condescending to younger readers or boring older ones
- Getting the science right—I don't want ornithologists cringing at errors
- Managing multiple platform versions without going crazy
- The paid vs. free Substack split—what justifies paying?
- Sharp-shinned hawks are notoriously difficult to photograph well (small, fast, skittish)
- ID confusion with Cooper's Hawk is a minefield—need to handle carefully
- Some birders have strong feelings about accipiters at feeders ("murderers!")—tone matters
- My personal anecdotes need to be genuinely interesting, not just "I saw a bird once"

---

## Constraints

- No budget for professional photography—using my own photos or properly credited free sources
- Must maintain consistent voice across platforms while adapting format

---

## Preferences

- Writing style: conversational but knowledgeable, like explaining to a curious friend
- Avoid academic jargon unless defining it
- Anecdotes should have narrative arc (setup, tension, payoff)
- Prefer active voice
- Use humor sparingly but genuinely

---

## Technical Aspects

N/A—this is a natural history topic, not a technical one.

---

## Outputs & Platforms

**Blog:**
- Long-form, can include many images
- Platform: (specify)

**Twitter:**
- Threads, punchy, 280-char chunks, limited images
- Standard account with threading capability

**Substack:**
- Already configured for paid/free tiers
- Free: Main narrative, core natural history, 2-3 anecdotes
- Paid: Extended anecdotes, ID deep-dive (sharpie vs Cooper's), behind-the-scenes of my observations, photo gallery with commentary, recommended resources

**Cross-platform considerations:**
- Image sizing/formatting differs per platform
- Consider scheduling posts strategically (birding seasons, migration timing)

## Other Notes

**Possible series structure:**
Could break this into themed installments rather than one massive piece—hunting behavior, identification, migration, backyard encounters, etc.
