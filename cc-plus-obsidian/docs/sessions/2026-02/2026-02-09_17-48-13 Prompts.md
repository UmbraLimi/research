# Session Prompts — 2026-02-09 17:48

1. `/init` — Create CLAUDE.md for the project
2. Our goal is to consult PLANNING.md and create PLAN.md as our action plan. We need to consider my existing Obsidian Vault for the kinds of information I store there.
3. I have a lot of folders used as Claude Code projects. Global commands need a prefix. I suggest "cco" as in /cco-do-this.md
4. Update PLANNING.md with the cco- prefix convention
5. Let's start with /journal fully available as well. And credentials will disappear as they will be found inside many vendor notes.
6. Dataview plugin — what role will it play? My current vault uses it heavily but it is brittle and dependent on Daily Notes headings containing tasks.
7. Which timecards, a full journal between dates, and tasks with priorities — these are the reports I need.
8. I need to standardize structure for timecards, Slack threads, email threads, Zoom meetings, site visits. Templates have a fatal flaw in Obsidian — when you change them you have to manually adjust all existing records. I need a backfill system.
9. Can I access the CC system from mobile?
10. Biggest mobile use case: looking up tasks and journal reports. Maybe entering data into daily notes.
11. DataviewJS on Android doesn't work. Can you confirm?
12. Update PLANNING.md with mobile constraint. But pre-rendered dashboards violate single source of truth. I've heard CC can run headless — can we take advantage?
13. Let's go through the open questions.
14. My current vault is at ~/Obsidian Vaults/main2025. I'm open to any location but there will be 2 vaults.
15. ~/Vaults/main and ~/Vaults/private
16. Session granularity — I run multiple sessions per day. Don't need to separate times except for meetings, timecards, and communications.
17. I let you decide on the PLAN structure. But I maintain a COMPLETED-PLAN.md. Phases are named not numbered. Current sequence is at the top.
18. Start fresh, don't migrate old docs.
19. TypeScript, it's what I know best. But keep in mind where Python would serve better.
20. (Showed two timecard examples from current vault — coding and meeting)
21. Timecards should be their own individual notes, queryable with schema frontmatter.
22. I need separate folders for coding, non-coding, meeting, slack, email, telegram. Most reports are project-specific and involve multiple card types. A report will show all timecards for Block-04 of Project PeerLoop.
23. No spaces in filenames. "Peer Loop" was a typo.
24. No delegation. I'd like to use "+" for importance. I need to quickly designate a task as important.
25. We need queryability, so I will adjust (accepted `[importance:: N]` inline field conversion).
26. Update PLANNING.md with everything we've decided (open questions).
27. I've shown you coding and meeting cards. Now that cards are in their own notes, what format do you have in mind?
28. (Showed a more complex coding card spanning 3 git commits)
29. For Client and For Admin are separate sections. The entire coding timecard is created by a skill. (Showed /q-timecard and /q-timecard-local skills)
30. How will you get access to the git repo from the vault? I will need you to parse daily notes for migrating existing timecards.
31. (Showed Slack card example)
32. Start and end times are required for slack. Here's a non-coding timecard for XLATE-Pilot.
33. (Showed email card example)
34. Email body — I'll summarize in bullet points instead of quoting verbatim. The cont'd field will be a wikilink to prior email card.
35. I don't have a finalized Telegram, so assume similar to Slack.
36. Update PLANNING.md with the card types.
37. (Showed phone call template)
38. Phone call is a variant of Meeting.
39. (Showed site visit template)
40. That's it for now (card types).
41. Let's wrap up this session with documentation, then start fresh next session.
42. Push it.
43. You should NEVER perform a rebase without asking first!
44. Are there any repercussions to git history due to your rebase?
45. Add to your memory file and CLAUDE.md that you should always ask for explicit permission on history-changing git commands.
46. Yes (commit and push the git rules update).
47. I want to capture what we learned and what I asked. I think /par-learnings and /par-prompts do this.
48. Yes (run both).
