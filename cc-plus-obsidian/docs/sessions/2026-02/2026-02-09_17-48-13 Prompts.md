# Session Prompts — 2026-02-09 17:48

1. `/init` — Create CLAUDE.md for the project
2. Our goal is to consult PLANNING.md and create PLAN.md as our action plan. We need to consider my existing Obsidian Vault for the kinds of information I store there.
3. I have a lot of folders used as Claude Code projects. Global commands need a prefix. I suggest "cco" as in /cco-do-this.md
4. Update PLANNING.md with the cco- prefix convention
5. Let's start with /journal fully available as well. And credentials will disappear as they will be found inside many vendor notes.
6. Dataview plugin — what role will it play? My current vault uses it heavily but it is brittle and dependent on Daily Notes headings containing tasks.
7. Which timecards, a full journal between dates, and tasks with priorities — these are the reports I need.
8. I need to standardize structure for timecards, Slack threads, email threads, Zoom meetings, site visits. Templates have a fatal flaw in Obsidian — when you change them you have to manually adjust all existing records. I need a backfill system.
9. Can I access the CC system from mobile?
10. Biggest mobile use case: looking up tasks and journal reports. Maybe entering data into daily notes.
11. DataviewJS on Android doesn't work. Can you confirm?
12. Update PLANNING.md with mobile constraint. But pre-rendered dashboards violate single source of truth. I've heard CC can run headless — can we take advantage?
13. Let's go through the open questions.
14. My current vault is at ~/Obsidian Vaults/main2025. I'm open to any location but there will be 2 vaults.
15. ~/Vaults/main and ~/Vaults/private
16. Session granularity — I run multiple sessions per day. Don't need to separate times except for meetings, timecards, and communications.
17. I let you decide on the PLAN structure. But I maintain a COMPLETED-PLAN.md. Phases are named not numbered. Current sequence is at the top.
18. Start fresh, don't migrate old docs.
19. TypeScript, it's what I know best. But keep in mind where Python would serve better.
20. (Showed two timecard examples from current vault — coding and meeting)
21. Timecards should be their own individual notes, queryable with schema frontmatter.
22. I need separate folders for coding, non-coding, meeting, slack, email, telegram. Most reports are project-specific and involve multiple card types. A report will show all timecards for Block-04 of Project PeerLoop.
23. No spaces in filenames. "Peer Loop" was a typo.
24. No delegation. I'd like to use "+" for importance. I need to quickly designate a task as important.
25. We need queryability, so I will adjust (accepted `[importance:: N]` inline field conversion).
26. Update PLANNING.md with everything we've decided (open questions).
27. I've shown you coding and meeting cards. Now that cards are in their own notes, what format do you have in mind?
28. (Showed a more complex coding card spanning 3 git commits)
29. For Client and For Admin are separate sections. The entire coding timecard is created by a skill. (Showed /q-timecard and /q-timecard-local skills)
30. How will you get access to the git repo from the vault? I will need you to parse daily notes for migrating existing timecards.
31. (Showed Slack card example)
32. Start and end times are required for slack. Here's a non-coding timecard for XLATE-Pilot.
33. (Showed email card example)
34. Email body — I'll summarize in bullet points instead of quoting verbatim. The cont'd field will be a wikilink to prior email card.
35. I don't have a finalized Telegram, so assume similar to Slack.
36. Update PLANNING.md with the card types.
37. (Showed phone call template)
38. Phone call is a variant of Meeting.
39. (Showed site visit template)
40. That's it for now (card types).
41. Let's wrap up this session with documentation, then start fresh next session.
42. Push it.
43. You should NEVER perform a rebase without asking first!
44. Are there any repercussions to git history due to your rebase?
45. Add to your memory file and CLAUDE.md that you should always ask for explicit permission on history-changing git commands.
46. Yes (commit and push the git rules update).
47. I want to capture what we learned and what I asked. I think /par-learnings and /par-prompts do this.
48. Yes (run both).

## Continued — 19:53

49. Let's start implementing the plan.
50. Yes, move on to GLOBAL-SKILLS schemas.
51. Yes, continue (to SESSION-CLOSE skill).
52. Yes, continue (to PROCESS-DAILY, MIGRATE-SCHEMA, PROJECT-INIT skills).
53. Let's do a checkpoint commit first, using /q-commit, then integration test.
54. Are these files disappearing? In which branch are you currently? (Concern about deleting repo narrative files on main)
55. The main branch is very out of date. I need you to work with a new branch which is a copy of staging branch. Call the copy of staging "xx3". Then you can make those same changes on the new xx3 branch.
56. Yes, move it. (Confirmed PeerLoop repo relocation)
57. Yes, continue (integration testing after commit).
58. Skip for now. (Deferred /cco-session-close end-to-end test)
59. Let's end the session, /par-end-session.

## Continued — 08:10 (session 4)

60. Why did you think you needed to delete tasks? What was your directive to do that? I don't want this happening again and I don't see any changes that you made to guard this from happening again.
61. Add directive: "Your goal is never to make files shorter. But if you feel the content can be removed, confirm that content being removed first."
62. /r-commit (deferred phases + content preservation rules)
63. I have entered an old Daily note (via copy/paste) into /Vaults/main/journal/daily/2025-12-03.md. How do I process it?
64. /cco-process-daily 2025-12-03 (test run against real old daily note)
65. This was a test. The correction is not for you to reason about what is a project. Your task is to see a wikilink, determine the note it points to, then if the note exists, execute. Whenever something fails, halt that whole heading and move on.
66. Update the skill file and record the decision.
67. /r-commit (wikilink resolution and missing project folder decisions)
68. Do we have a way of clearing the notes in the vault so we can start fresh?
69. All the notes, but not the folders. I want to work on one aspect at a time, perfect it, then move on.
70. I want to run /cco-project-init "Peer Loop" — does the skill support that?
71. Let's discuss projects vs vendors vs people vs software. Do we have to use folders for classification?
72. Can type in frontmatter be multi-valued? When Cloudflare has 4 projects using it, how do you organize frontmatter and body?
73. Your single type per note echoes the same issue that folders had.
74. I'm not sure we have made any decisions. But from your perspective, what have we decided?
75. Firm up directional items: (1) folders for containment YES, (2) type as multi-valued list YES, (3) one note per entity YES, (4) generic /cco-create NO, (5) schema per type YES for consistency and backfill.
76. /par-end-session
