## Development Transcript

### Meeting Template Discovery

**User:** Asked if there's a template for meetings — attended a Zoom meeting today.

**Claude:** Found the meeting card schema in PLANNING.md and presented the full spec including frontmatter fields, body sections, and daily note shorthand format.

### First Meeting Skeleton Entry

**User:** Asked for help writing up the Zoom meeting in today's daily note.

**Claude:** Asked for attendees, times, project, and content details. Created a meeting skeleton in 2026-02-11.md under the existing "Gabriel's AI Consortium" heading. User filled in Discussion, Decisions, and Tasks content directly in Obsidian.

### Friction in Meeting Entry Workflow

**User:** Found the interaction had too many friction points — too many questions, missing fields (record, bill). Wanted a faster way to enter meetings.

**Claude:** Proposed three options: (A) one-liner convention, (B) `/cco-meeting` skill, (C) Obsidian templates. User pointed out that option A has no mechanism for CC to learn/stay consistent across sessions.

### `/cco-meeting` Skill Design and Creation

**User:** Wanted a workflow where they give a natural language one-liner, CC parses it, then invokes a skill with structured arguments.

**Claude:** Created `/cco-meeting` skill at `~/.claude/commands/cco-meeting.md`. Skill accepts key=value args (via, start, end, who, focus, bill, record, heading, etc.) and writes a consistent skeleton to the daily note. Added to CLAUDE.md skill table.

### Testing — Gabriel's AI Consortium Meeting

**User:** Provided meeting details as a one-liner equivalent through Q&A.

**Claude:** Generated skeleton, but missed `record` and `bill` fields. User flagged both issues. Added `bill` to meeting card schema in PLANNING.md (same pattern as coding cards). Added `Record` to daily note sample.

### Testing — ForBusinessSake In-Person Meeting

**User:** "meeting with Debbie and Brad Pardiac, at the office of For Business Sake, 15:00 - 16:00, no bill, no record"

**Claude:** Invoked `/cco-meeting` skill. Wrote skeleton to daily note. User corrected: date should be Feb 11 (yesterday), not Feb 10. Fixed by moving content to correct daily note.

### Meeting Schema Review

**User:** Asked to see the meeting schema. Claude presented the full spec from PLANNING.md.

### Unified Timecard Format Redesign

**User:** Pointed out the skill had too many exceptions (Meeting vs Phone Call vs Site Visit, different icons, wikilink vs plain text for Via). Opened discussion about redesigning all daily note timecard entries.

**Claude:** Proposed two directions: (A) unified heading with via carrying nuance, (B) broader rethink of all timecard types. User chose B.

**Claude:** Presented a comprehensive unified format covering all seven card types with consistent heading format, shared inline fields, type-specific fields, and flexible body sections.

### Existing Comms Skills Review

**User:** Revealed existing `/r-slack`, `/r-email`, `/r-otter` skills in `~/MyResearch/Comm-Helpers/.claude/commands/`.

**Claude:** Read all five files (r-slack, r-email, r-otter, slack-reference, email-reference). Identified significant differences from the unified format: heading formats, field names, body section levels, task formats, output methods.

### Key Design Clarifications

**User:** Clarified several critical points:
1. Don't merge all skills into one — `/cco-meeting` is for quick skeletons, comms skills are for screenshot/transcript processing
2. Drop Obsidian Tasks plugin format — use `[importance:: N]` inline fields
3. Otter transcripts go inside meeting timecards as `#### Transcript`, not separate cards
4. Slack and Email stay in timecard format (`### {icon}`) as separate skills
5. Body sections must use `####` to nest under `###` timecard headings
6. Drop type-specific icons, keep only 🕒 for regex
7. Daily note is the working surface — no shortcut from one-liner to card note

### Implementation

**Claude:** Updated three things:
1. `/cco-meeting` skill — rewritten with `####` body sections, unified heading format, via wikilink logic, card type labels (Meeting, Phone Call, Site Visit)
2. Daily notes (2026-02-11, 2026-02-12) — fixed heading levels and format
3. PLANNING.md — updated daily note format section, all six card type specs, heading hierarchy documentation

### Testing — Big Blue Button Meeting

**User:** "meeting with Brian using Big Blue Button for the video session. On Feb 10. 10:00 - 10:55. Status of PeerLoop development. Not recorded, billable as Block-05"

**Claude:** Checked vault for Big Blue Button (found software note). Invoked `/cco-meeting` with correct args. Created 2026-02-10.md with properly formatted skeleton. Output matched the unified format correctly.

### Session Documentation

**User:** Invoked `/q-learn-decide`.

**Claude:** Created Learnings.md (6 learnings) and Decisions.md (10 decisions). Updated root DECISIONS.md with 8 Important decisions.

## Session Prompts

- I attended a Zoom meeting today. Is there a template we are using for meetings?
- yes, help me write it up in today's daily note
- Gabriel + many new participants 13:30 - 14:35
- When I learn their names, what is the process whereby I add them as people to Obsidian? Can I do so in Obsidian, or do I use you to enter them for me?
- No yet. I am not sure I will be staying with this group yet. Can you show me the schema for meetings?
- A few comments: when you made up the meeting record, you didn't add record. Always add that to the skeleton you provide. And a new schema item needs to be added: Block. This is used if the meeting is to be billed and "No" is added if it is not to be billed
- update PLANNING.md, same pattern as coding card
- update the daily note skeleton too
- I am finding this interaction between us to have lots of friction points. I would prefer if we had a skill where I could add a meeting of a particular type, or if you can provide a template I can ask you to place in a daily note. Or maybe you have a better idea how to speed up Meeting entry instructions to you
- How do you see A and B working together? That requires that /cco-meeting of Option B be being built as I make the on-liner requests of option A. Or have I got that wrong?
- My issue is you being consistent and adapting. I see no mechanism for you learning in the way you are proposing
- yes let's test it. I had a meeting yesterday with Debbie and Brad Pardiac, at the office of For Business Sake, 15:00 - 16:00, no bill, no record
- meeting with my accountant about dealing with large increase in revenue
- 1. Yesterday was Feb 11, not Feb 10. 2. How do you decide what the heading should be?
- You made the correct inference. But I may want to pre-specify the heading
- Had a phone call with Brian today (09:30 - 09:42) not billable, not recorded, about Peerloop invoicing
- A few things: 1) is [[Brian LeBlanc]] the correct wikilink for Brian?, 2) Do we have [[Phone]] in the vault?, 3) I would like "Phone Call" instead of "Meeting" (and change the icon) for the level 3 heading
- The meeting at For Business Sake shows In-person. Why not Site visit? Both are correct but Site Visit shows I went there as opposed to them coming to me. I think our skill has too many exceptions. I am open to re-organizing and redefining the whole daily note entry for time cards. It is expected that half of the time, you will be subsequently processing these entries you are making with /cco-process-daily
- B (choosing broader rethink of all timecard types)
- This is a good direction. When the /cco-process-daily skill runs now, what does the note look like? Are the inline variables turned into frontmatter variables for each ## heading that becomes a single note?
- Yes. The key here is that reports (and TSV exports) will be made from these timecards that make it into individual notes. The Heading of the daily note may change, or be augmented by me manually, so we can't directly go to the single note directly from the one-liner I send you.
- yes, let's redesign the format. Keep in mind that I have already written skills to handle Slack and Telegram and email using screen captures. I will be moving them here so that you can adjust them (they were written for the old Obsidian Vault)
- the skills are in ~/MyResearch/Comm-Helpers/.claude/commands
- 1. Let's drop timecard-type icons. We will keep the clock for regex
- They create a form similar to the daily note format. I will make them available to you in this session
- 1. Drop Tasks plugin. Use our current thinking on tasks. 2. Body level headings should continue the heading hierarchy and be contained by the timecard. 3. Otter is meant to sit in the body of the timecard like #### Tasks and #### Discussion. (i.e. #### Transcript). Slack and Email are in Timecard format (i.e. ### {icon} Slack) as they are in the incoming skills
- Forcing all of these new skills into a single skill I think is a mistake. The purpose of the ones you are now working on is to get a quick skeleton that is minimally fleshed out by my one liner input. These others start as screenshots (not sure about the email). The Task format depended upon the Tasks Obsidian plugin. Not sure we are using that any more. The Otter transcript goes inside a timecard already in the daily note where record:: is filled in. This is a manual skill I invoke as needed. Ask any more questions you need
- let's test it again with another meeting. I had a meeting with Brian using Big Blue Button for the video session. On Feb 10. 10:00 - 10:55. We talked about the status of my development of Peerloop. Not recorded, billable as Block-05
- that looks right, /q-learn-decide
- /q-dump
