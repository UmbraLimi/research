# Session Learnings - 2026-02-12

## 1. `[[expect]]` Is a Wikilink Collection Pattern, Not an Obsidian Tasks Plugin Feature
**Topics:** task-management, obsidian, wikilinks

**Context:** While migrating comms skills from Comm-Helpers, CC treated `[[expect]]` as part of the Obsidian Tasks plugin format and replaced it with plain text "Follow up:".

**Learning:** `[[expect]]` is a wikilink that creates a backlink collection point in Obsidian — click it and see everything you're waiting for. It has nothing to do with the Tasks plugin. When dropping plugin syntax (`🔺`, `⏳`), analyze each pattern individually: some are plugin-dependent (emoji markers), others are pure Obsidian features (wikilinks) that provide real workflow value.

## 2. Preserve Functional Value When Dropping Plugin Syntax
**Topics:** task-management, migration, design-pattern

**Context:** The decision "drop Obsidian Tasks plugin format" was interpreted as "drop everything the old skills used for tasks" — including dates and the `[[expect]]` pattern.

**Learning:** "Drop the plugin format" means drop the plugin-specific syntax (`🔺` priority emoji, `⏳` due date emoji). It does NOT mean drop the underlying information (deadlines, tracking commitments). Dates are real data. `[[expect]]` is a functional pattern. The right approach: strip the plugin-specific markers, keep the data in a new format (`[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]`), and preserve patterns that aren't plugin-dependent at all.

## 3. Don't Add Cognitive Overhead to Every Task
**Topics:** task-management, workflow, cc-skills

**Context:** CC added `[importance:: N]` to every skill-generated task, requiring an importance judgment for every checkbox.

**Learning:** Importance is a human editorial judgment, not something to auto-assign. Skill-generated tasks should be plain `- [ ]` checkboxes. The `+` importance notation exists for hand-written tasks under `##` headings where the user deliberately signals priority. Blanket importance ratings create cognitive clutter — the user has to evaluate whether each rating is correct rather than just scanning tasks.

## 4. When Told to "Make Consistent", Ask What Consistency Means
**Topics:** cc-skills, workflow

**Context:** User said "import and make consistent" for the Comm-Helpers skills. CC interpreted this broadly and made structural changes (heading hierarchy, task format) without confirming scope.

**Learning:** "Make consistent" can mean naming consistency (the `cco-` prefix), reference consistency (updating cross-references), or structural consistency (heading levels, task format). The safe approach: do the mechanical consistency (naming, references) first, then flag structural differences for discussion rather than unilaterally changing them.

## 5. Otter Skill Heading Level May Conflict with Earlier Decision
**Topics:** daily-notes, otter, heading-hierarchy

**Context:** Changed `/cco-otter` output from `####`/`#####` to `###`/`####` to match other card types. But the earlier session decided "Otter transcripts are `#### Transcript` body sections inside a meeting timecard, not separate cards."

**Learning:** If the Otter transcript is meant to nest inside a meeting timecard (`### 🕒 Meeting`), its heading should be `####` (not `###`). The standalone `/cco-otter` skill producing `###` output would only be correct if the transcript is placed as a peer of the meeting timecard, not inside it. This tension between "Otter as body section" and "Otter as standalone card" needs resolution — flagging for future session.
