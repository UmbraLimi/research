# Session Learnings - 2026-02-12

## 1. Skill-Enforced Consistency Beats Conversational Conventions
**Topics:** cc-skills, workflow

**Context:** Attempted to establish a "one-liner convention" where the user would describe meetings and CC would generate consistent skeletons. The user pointed out: "I see no mechanism for you learning in the way you are proposing."

**Learning:** CC starts every session fresh. A verbal convention has no enforcement mechanism — CC will forget fields, change order, or ask unnecessary questions. A skill (markdown prompt file loaded at invocation) guarantees the same output format every time. When consistency matters, always build a skill rather than relying on conversational memory.

## 2. Separate Fuzzy Parsing from Rigid Output
**Topics:** cc-skills, workflow, design-pattern

**Context:** Designing the meeting entry workflow — the user wanted to give natural language one-liners but get perfectly formatted output every time.

**Learning:** The pattern "natural language → CC parses → CC invokes skill with structured args → skill enforces rigid template" cleanly separates what CC is good at (understanding flexible input) from what it's bad at (producing identical output across sessions). The user never touches the structured args — CC is the translation layer.

## 3. Daily Note Heading Hierarchy Must Support Parsing
**Topics:** daily-notes, heading-levels, cco-process-daily

**Context:** Initial meeting skeletons used `##` for body sections (Discussion, Tasks, etc.) which put them at the same level as qualifying `##` headings.

**Learning:** The heading hierarchy `## qualifying → ### timecard → #### body sections` is not just an organizational convention — it's a parsing requirement. `/cco-process-daily` needs heading levels to determine what content belongs to which timecard. Body sections at `##` would be indistinguishable from new qualifying headings.

## 4. Via Field Wikilink Logic Requires Vault Checking
**Topics:** daily-notes, wikilinks

**Context:** Wrote `[[Phone]]` and `[[In-Person]]` as Via values, but neither has a vault note. Meanwhile `[[Zoom]]` and `[[Big Blue Button]]` do.

**Learning:** The `Via` field should only be wikilinked if the value has an actual vault note (vendor or software entity). Generic terms like Phone, In-Person, Site Visit are plain text. Always check the vault before wikilink-wrapping a Via value.

## 5. Different Input Paths Need Different Skills
**Topics:** cc-skills, design-pattern

**Context:** Considered unifying the `/cco-meeting` skeleton skill with the existing comms skills (`/r-slack`, `/r-email`, `/r-otter`) into a single skill.

**Learning:** The one-liner meeting skill and the comms processing skills serve fundamentally different purposes despite both producing daily note content. Meeting skill: quick skeleton from minimal input. Comms skills: rich extraction from screenshots/transcripts. Merging them would create a bloated skill with too many code paths. Keep skills focused on one input type.

## 6. Existing Comms Skills Already Had Correct Heading Hierarchy
**Topics:** daily-notes, comm-helpers

**Context:** Reviewed `/r-slack`, `/r-email`, `/r-otter` from Comm-Helpers and found they already used `####` for body sections under `###` timecard headings.

**Learning:** The old Comm-Helpers skills were already structurally compatible with the new hierarchy convention. The heading level problem was only in the new `/cco-meeting` skill. When migrating the comms skills, the heading hierarchy won't need changing — only the heading format and field names may need alignment.
