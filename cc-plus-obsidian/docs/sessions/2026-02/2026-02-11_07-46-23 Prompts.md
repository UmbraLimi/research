1. What is the procedure when I want to add a new vendor to the vault?
2. What are the pros and cons of creating a skill /r-add-vendor to do this process?
3. I agree. Still, the Pros are important as is the workaround you suggested. Therefore we need a document entitled HOW-TO.md. In this document will be examples of how to do things that I can ask CC to do that don't need the rigor of a skill. Let's start by adding how to add a new vendor.
4. What is your assessment of the utility of this new document?
5. Over time, I might forget how to ask for a new vendor. I might say "I need to add Cloudflare as a supplier of Pages and Workers." Would you know that Cloudflare was already a vendor and that Pages and/or Workers was a service?
6. Rewrite it with the broader framing.
7. What should we name this document, and what should we put into a section for projects in keeping with its new purpose?
8. I have a better name ENTITIES.md and inside is explained what can be done with each entity that we handle. In that scoping, a section on Projects and People makes sense. And yes, this is a document primarily for me, but I want it to capture how we are treating entities. For example a vendor has accounts, but we are explicitly not creating a note for accounts entities. A small note added to ENTITIES.md under Vendors would explain that accounts are found inside Vendor notes. Same for services.
9. Let's work on software next. (Entered plan mode, explored codebase, designed schema)
10. (During planning) Before you exit plan mode, I think you should take a look at some existing records of software. (Provided 14 old vault paths)
11. (Answered plan mode questions: reference/software/ location, flexible ## structure, repository in frontmatter, credentials case-by-case, type list for classification)
12. Let's add the notes that I just gave you to Obsidian. (Migrated 14 old software notes — 7 with content, 6 stubs, 1 skipped)
13. Let's add aliases to projects and vendors. (Bumped vendor schema to v2, backfilled 8 vendor notes)
14. I have some more records to add as a test to see if you can determine what entity they represent. Here's the first: Cloudflare + PeerLoop.md
15. Yes (add it to the Cloudflare vendor note)
16. Add it to Offerings (R2 added to Cloudflare Offerings section)
17. (Provided 6 more old vault paths: Big Blue Button, Anthropic API Account, Google Gemini, Otter AI, Stream, Wise Money)
18. (Answered classification questions: Gemini = software note, Otter/Stream = both vendors)
19. (Provided 22 more old vault paths: Amazon through Zoom)
20. (Answered classification questions: merge Anthropic API keys, Obsidian software note for cheatsheet/tools, 3 separate Claude product notes)
