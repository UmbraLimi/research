1. Implement the following plan: [Reframe vault documentation as practice management system — detailed plan with 3 files, specific locations, and execution order]
2. push it
3. /par-end-session

## Continued — 20:31

4. Review PLAN, CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md, DECISIONS.md for vendor note design. Then look at 10 Cloudflare notes from old vault to see how they should be constructed in the new vault. [provided file paths]
5. The Peerloop + Cloudflare note is not yet created. Let's try to create your schema and the note that would accompany it
6. Write both files, but change the project wikilinks to use no-spaces convention
7. Now update PLAN.md to reflect what we just completed
8. Now let's look at the other vendor notes I need to migrate [started globbing old vault]
9. I will give you the notes - do not search the other vault on your own. Add that edict to CLAUDE.md
10. This one is Github. All the rest of the vendors are relatively simple... [provided Github + Github+translation-system paths]
11. Create the Github record now. I want to see how this develops as a vendor schema and see how versions come into play
12. A new Vendor: DeepL. This vendor bares the marks of being copied from Cloudflare, so be careful [provided 3 DeepL paths]
13. Digital Ocean and Resend — these are separate vendors [provided 2 paths]
14. Consider Slack and Telegram as communication communities. Slack has owners (AIM, CFU, SAGE) and within each are channels and DMs [provided 8 Slack paths]
15. Interesting. Let's leave it that way. Here's Telegram [provided 2 Telegram paths]
16. I have a few more notes for Slack [provided 3 more Slack paths]
17. How are you handling the different channels? I still want to link to them in daily notes — how is this possible with a single note?
18. If a wikilink starts as "[[Slack#" doesn't that show headings in a dropdown?
19. The con is the wikilinks embedded in text are long and not easily readable. Can aliases be added to internal wikilinks?
20. When you use an alias for a note, you can link with just the alias. Can internal headings also have their own alias?
21. The clutter in the folder of files which are notes vs stubs. Also, how to maintain new sections in say cloudflare.md and the stubs that are required
22. None of these is feeling ok... we have the opportunity to add a predictable alias when we run /cco-process-daily. All we would need is to maintain a table of heading aliases
23. Yes! [capture as decision]
24. Create a test note for Cloudflare.md (Cloudflare-2.md) so I can see the two forms together
25. I like the new Cloudflare-2 version. It should be made clear what each heading level means
26. Yes, restructure Slack.md the same way
27. Where do the heading hierarchies get written? To the vendor schema or the vendor note?
28. Review the schema vs what you used for Slack and Cloudflare. Do you see conflict? Let's discuss
29. I agree. So how shall we handle this variability in the heading level naming?
30. Now restructure DeepL.md the same way
31. Do the same for Telegram.md
32. Any more vendors to update?
33. I would like to tackle Google. Here are the services I use... [listed services and 3 email accounts]
34. I use fg@bsa, f@mer and f@tfr. The email notes are just named notes with no content
35. Now update PLAN.md and commit everything
36. /par-end-session
