1. **Vendor schema created (v1)** — 6 frontmatter fields (type, schema-version, name, url, status-page, created). Body structure adapts per vendor rather than enforcing rigid template.

2. **Sub-resources are headings, not stub notes** — Channels, databases, services, etc. are `###`/`####` headings within the parent vendor note. Link with `[[VendorName#heading]]`. Avoids folder clutter and maintenance drift vs. separate stub files.

3. **Heading names use `•`-separated self-describing paths** — e.g., `CFU • D1 • essays` so they're unambiguous in Obsidian's `[[VendorName#` autocomplete dropdown.

4. **Heading-level meanings are per-note, not universal** — Schema defines only that `##` is the top-level division (account/workspace). `###` and `####` adapt per vendor. Complex notes include a key line blockquote explaining their levels.

5. **Heading alias resolution deferred to `/cco-process-daily`** — Vendor notes will store `heading-aliases` in frontmatter. During daily note processing, verbose heading links get rewritten to clean aliased form automatically.

6. **`type: [vendor, communication]` for Slack/Telegram** — Communication platforms are classified as both vendor and communication using the multi-valued type list.

7. **Old vault read restriction** — Added to CLAUDE.md: never read from `~/Obsidian Vaults/main2025/` without explicit instruction. User provides old vault content when needed.

8. **8 vendor notes created** — Cloudflare (full, from 10 old notes), DeepL (full, from 3), Slack (full, from 8), Google (skeleton), GitHub, DigitalOcean, Resend, Telegram (skeletons).
