## Decision 1: PeerLoop Branch for Vault Integration Changes

**Context**: CLAUDE.md needed a Vault Integration section added, but main branch was very out of date.

**Options Considered**:
1. Make changes on main
2. Create branch from staging called `xx3` ← Chosen
3. Create a feature branch with a descriptive name

**Decision**: Create `xx3` from staging for all PeerLoop repo changes related to vault integration.

**Rationale**: User identified that main was stale. Staging has the current code. The `xx3` naming follows the user's existing branch naming convention (jfg-dev, jfg-dev-2, etc. suggest iterative branches).

## Decision 2: Skills as Markdown Prompts (Not Code)

**Context**: The 4 `cco-*` skills needed to be implemented. Could be code (TypeScript/Python scripts) or CC prompt files.

**Options Considered**:
1. TypeScript scripts executed by CC
2. Python scripts executed by CC
3. Markdown prompt files in `~/.claude/commands/` ← Chosen

**Decision**: Implement all 4 skills as markdown prompt files that CC interprets and executes step-by-step.

**Rationale**: Markdown prompts are immediately testable, require no build step, and leverage CC's ability to read/write files directly. The skills are orchestration workflows (read this, write that, parse this), not compute-heavy operations. If any step needs refinement, editing the markdown is instant.

## Decision 3: Defer /cco-session-close E2E Test

**Context**: Integration testing was nearly complete, but `/cco-session-close` requires a real repo with git commits.

**Options Considered**:
1. Simulate with fake git history
2. Test against PeerLoop repo now ← Considered
3. Defer to first real use ← Chosen

**Decision**: Skip the `/cco-session-close` end-to-end test and validate it during the first real session close on PeerLoop.

**Rationale**: The skill integrates `/q-git-history` which is already battle-tested. Simulating git history adds complexity without much confidence. First real use will be a better test.

## Decision 4: Meristics Project Folder Created Ad-Hoc

**Context**: During `/cco-process-daily` testing, the Slack card referenced `[[Meristics]]` which had no project folder.

**Options Considered**:
1. Skip entirely and warn ← Per spec
2. Create minimal folder for task file ← Chosen
3. Run `/cco-project-init Meristics`

**Decision**: Created `projects/meristics/` with just the task file during processing. Full project init deferred.

**Rationale**: The skill spec says to create the task file if missing but warn about the missing project log. This was the correct behavior — partial setup is better than losing the extracted task.
