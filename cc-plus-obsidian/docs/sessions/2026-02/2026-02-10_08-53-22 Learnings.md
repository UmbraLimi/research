## Documentation Reframing

- **Reframing docs without removing content is a distinct task type.** The content preservation rule ("never delete or collapse plan content") makes reframing work additive-only: reword openings, add framing notes before examples, and move project-specific rows to dedicated sections. No content is lost, but the reader's mental model shifts from "this is a PeerLoop tool" to "this is a practice management system."

- **Titles propagate identity.** Changing "CC + Obsidian Integration" to "CC + Obsidian Vault System" in DECISIONS.md and PLANNING.md immediately shifts how the project reads. Small title changes have outsized framing effect.

- **Italic one-liners before code blocks are effective framing.** Adding `*Shown with PeerLoop as the example project...*` before diagrams and code examples clarifies scope without modifying the examples themselves. This pattern works well for any doc where a specific instance illustrates a general system.

## Workflow

- **Plan-then-execute with explicit task tracking works well for multi-file doc changes.** Even though each individual edit was small, having 9 touch points across PLANNING.md benefited from the structured approach — no locations were missed.

- **PLANNING.md title was not in the original plan but was obviously needed for consistency.** When DECISIONS.md title was updated and PLANNING.md still said "Integration", the inconsistency was clear. Worth catching during execution rather than leaving for a follow-up.

## Vendor Note Architecture

- **"One note per entity" + linkable headings is the sweet spot.** Consolidating Cloudflare's 10 old-vault files into one note eliminated folder clutter and maintenance drift while keeping all content accessible. The key insight: most sub-notes had only 2-5 lines of real content once DataviewJS boilerplate was stripped.

- **Heading names must be self-describing for autocomplete to work.** When Obsidian shows a `[[VendorName#` dropdown, headings like `essays` are ambiguous — `CFU • D1 • essays` tells you the account, service, and instance at a glance. The `•`-separator convention mirrors the old vault's file naming while living inside a single note.

- **Rigid heading-level meanings don't generalize across vendors.** Initially defined `##` = account, `###` = service category, `####` = resource. This fit Cloudflare perfectly but didn't map to Slack (workspace/channel-category/channel) or DeepL (account/mixed-sections). The fix: lock down only `##` as "top-level division" and let `###`/`####` adapt per vendor, with a key line in complex notes.

- **Stub notes solve autocomplete but create worse problems.** The old vault's per-channel files gave great wikilink autocomplete UX. But stub notes cause folder clutter (mixing 5 real notes with 30 stubs) and maintenance drift (add a heading, forget to create the stub). Heading links with deferred alias resolution via `/cco-process-daily` preserve the autocomplete UX without the downsides.

## Schema Design

- **The vendor schema is simpler than card schemas.** Only 6 frontmatter fields vs. 13+ for coding cards. The body structure does the heavy lifting — and body structure varies per vendor, which is why the schema defines conventions, not rigid templates.

- **`type: [vendor, communication]` handles cross-cutting classification cleanly.** Slack and Telegram are both vendors AND communication platforms. The multi-valued `type` list means `WHERE contains(type, "vendor")` finds them alongside Cloudflare, while `WHERE contains(type, "communication")` filters to just messaging platforms.

## Migration Patterns

- **Old vault notes copied between vendors carry artifacts.** DeepL's Offerings section was Cloudflare's (Pages, D1, etc.) — clearly pasted and never updated. When consolidating, always read critically rather than trusting the source structure.

- **Credentials from Joplin migrations may be duplicated or conflicting.** DeepL had two different passwords — one in the "current" section and one in "from Joplin." Flagging discrepancies with a visible callout (blockquote NOTE) rather than silently choosing one.
