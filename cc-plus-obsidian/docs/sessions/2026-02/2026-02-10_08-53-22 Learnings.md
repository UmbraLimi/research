## Documentation Reframing

- **Reframing docs without removing content is a distinct task type.** The content preservation rule ("never delete or collapse plan content") makes reframing work additive-only: reword openings, add framing notes before examples, and move project-specific rows to dedicated sections. No content is lost, but the reader's mental model shifts from "this is a PeerLoop tool" to "this is a practice management system."

- **Titles propagate identity.** Changing "CC + Obsidian Integration" to "CC + Obsidian Vault System" in DECISIONS.md and PLANNING.md immediately shifts how the project reads. Small title changes have outsized framing effect.

- **Italic one-liners before code blocks are effective framing.** Adding `*Shown with PeerLoop as the example project...*` before diagrams and code examples clarifies scope without modifying the examples themselves. This pattern works well for any doc where a specific instance illustrates a general system.

## Workflow

- **Plan-then-execute with explicit task tracking works well for multi-file doc changes.** Even though each individual edit was small, having 9 touch points across PLANNING.md benefited from the structured approach — no locations were missed.

- **PLANNING.md title was not in the original plan but was obviously needed for consistency.** When DECISIONS.md title was updated and PLANNING.md still said "Integration", the inconsistency was clear. Worth catching during execution rather than leaving for a follow-up.
