## Documentation Architecture

- **ENTITIES.md is more useful than HOW-TO.md or PLAYBOOK.md.** The first attempt (HOW-TO.md) framed things as procedures; the second reframing as an entity guide captures the real structure — what entities exist, what's nested inside them, and what you can ask CC to do. The document serves the human as a menu and CC as a reference.
- **Documents that duplicate what CC can already infer from schemas have low utility.** The vendor "how to add" recipe was essentially an indirection layer over the schema. The entity guide earns its value by documenting what's *not* in schemas — sub-resource nesting, cross-entity credential placement, vocabulary mappings.

## Schema Design

- **`aliases` is an Obsidian-native field worth including in entity schemas.** It enables wikilink resolution from alternate names (e.g., `[[Visual Studio Code]]` → `VSCode.md`, `[[DO]]` → `DigitalOcean.md`). Added to software schema at v1 (pre-notes) and vendor schema at v2 (backfilled 8 notes).
- **`repository` belongs in frontmatter for software entities** — queryable, unlike a body link. Not all software has a repo, so it's optional with default `""`.
- **Flexible `##` heading structure works better for software than for vendors.** Vendors have a natural `##` = account convention. Software notes vary too much (by topic, by version, by integration) to prescribe a heading convention. Key line (blockquote) recommended for complex notes.
- **`type` list handles classification without extra fields.** Secondary values like `[software, cli-tool]` or `[software, desktop-app]` replace the old hierarchical tag system (`software/desktop`, `software/javascript/library`) without needing separate platform/category fields.

## Entity Classification

- **The vendor vs. software boundary rule:** If you have an *account* with it and consume it as a *service*, it's a vendor. If you *install/run* it locally or it's a tool/library, it's software. SaaS products (Otter AI, Stream) are vendors; desktop apps and CLIs (Claude Code, JumpCut) are software.
- **Products within a vendor can be separate software notes.** Claude (web/desktop), Claude Code (CLI), and Claude Desktop are 3 separate software notes even though Anthropic is the vendor. The vendor note holds the account/API keys; the software notes hold usage patterns.
- **Credentials placement is case-by-case.** License keys and tool-specific logins go in the software note. Purchase history and API keys tied to a vendor account go in the vendor note. The goal is "where would I look for this first?"

## Migration Patterns

- **Old vault notes often contain compound entities.** "Cloudflare + PeerLoop" is not a new entity — it's a new account section within an existing vendor note. CC should always check for existing notes before creating new ones.
- **Most old notes are stubs.** Of ~35 old notes migrated, fewer than 10 had meaningful content. Creating schema-compliant stubs is still valuable — they establish the wikilink targets and frontmatter for future content.
- **Obsidian reference content (cheatsheets, tools) fits naturally as sections within the Obsidian software note** rather than as separate reference files.
