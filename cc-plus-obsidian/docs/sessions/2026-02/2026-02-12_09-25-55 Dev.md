# Session Log - 2026-02-12

## Development Transcript

### Checking Previous Session's Comm Skills Work

**User:** Asked whether Otter, email, and Slack skills were folded into `/cco-meeting` last session.

**Claude:** Inspected `/cco-meeting` and confirmed they were NOT folded in. Line 12 explicitly excludes Slack, Email, Telegram. Explained the current split: `/cco-meeting` for real-time skeleton entry, `/cco-process-daily` for after-the-fact extraction of Slack/Email/Telegram cards.

### Importing Comm-Helpers Skills

**User:** Requested importing skills from `~/MyResearch/Comm-Helpers/.claude/commands/` into `~/.claude/commands/` with `cco-` prefix.

**Claude:** Read all 5 source files (`r-otter`, `r-email`, `r-slack`, `email-reference`, `slack-reference`). Copied to global commands with `cco-` prefix. Updated all internal references: `/r-slack` → `/cco-slack`, `slack-reference.md` → `cco-slack-reference.md`, etc. Added missing frontmatter to `cco-email`. Fixed Otter heading hierarchy from `####`/`#####` to `###`/`####` to match other card types.

### Task Format Unification — First Attempt (Overcorrected)

**User:** Pointed out the incoming skills needed task format changes to match this project's conventions (no Obsidian Tasks plugin).

**Claude:** Explored PLANNING.md, DECISIONS.md, ENTITIES.md, and existing skills for task conventions. Found the decision: "Obsidian Tasks plugin format dropped." Replaced `🔺` with `[importance:: N]`, `⏳ YYYY-MM-DD` with nothing, `[[expect]]` with "Follow up:", across all three skills and all examples.

### User Pushback — Three Mistakes Identified

**User:** Pushed back strongly. Identified three problems: (1) importance scale on every task creates cognitive clutter, (2) dates were real information that got discarded, (3) `[[expect]]` was a wikilink collection pattern providing real workflow value — "Follow up:" loses the ability to find all waiting-for items in one place.

**Claude:** Acknowledged all three mistakes. Explained what was misunderstood about each. Asked how user wanted to handle dates, importance, and expect before making more changes.

**User:** Confirmed: `[[expect]]` back as-is, `[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]` for dates, plain `- [ ]` for skill tasks with no importance.

### Task Format — Corrected

**Claude:** Updated all three skills again: restored `[[expect]] [[Person]]` pattern, added `[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]` for explicit deadlines, stripped `[importance:: N]` from all skill-generated tasks and examples. Updated guidelines sections. Verified with grep — no artifacts remaining.

### `[[expect]]` vs `#expect` Discussion

**User:** Asked to discuss whether `[[expect]]` or `#expect` is the better choice.

**Claude:** Presented comparison table: wikilink gives backlinks + English readability + potential dashboard note; tag gives tag pane + hierarchy + no graph noise. Both equally greppable by CC.

**User:** Noted they don't want a dashboard cluttering notes — would rather ask CC for reports on demand. Asked which format CC finds easiest to search.

**Claude:** Honestly stated both are equally easy to grep. `[[expect]]` has marginally more distinctive pattern (zero false positives). Since retrieval is equal, readability tips it toward `[[expect]]`.

**User:** Locked in `[[expect]]`.

### Recording Decisions in DECISIONS.md

**Claude:** Added three new rows to Task Management section: `[[expect]]` wikilink decision, `[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]` format, skill-generated tasks plain checkboxes. Updated comms skills line (migration done), skill list (added cco-slack/email/otter + references).

### Updating PLANNING.md

**User:** Asked to update PLANNING.md to match.

**Claude:** Found and updated 15+ locations: Task Conventions section rewritten (was "Task Importance Convention"), all `/r-` skill references → `/cco-`, card examples stripped of `[importance::]`, task file example updated from `⏫ 📅` to `[importance::] [due::]`, email example uses `[[expect]]`, Slack/Email heading formats updated (removed "may evolve" caveat, corrected emoji), summary line #8 rewritten.

### Session Documentation

**User:** Invoked `/q-learn-decide`.

**Claude:** Created Learnings (5 items) and Decisions (4 items). Key learning: `[[expect]]` is an Obsidian wikilink pattern, not a Tasks plugin feature — don't conflate them. Flagged potential inconsistency between Otter heading levels and earlier decision about Otter as body section inside meeting timecards.

## Session Prompts

- last session I made available several skills to work with Otter, email and Slack. Did you fold them into the /cco-meeting skill?
- I need you to import and make consistent the skills in ~/MyResearch/Comm-Helpers/.claude/commands. You should end up with the same skills in this project but now starting with cco-
- In the previous session, we discussed at length the need to adjust these new incoming skills to match the format we use in this folder (cc-plus-obsidian). One of these was that we are NOT using the Tasks plugin and so the icon, etc annotation of tasks must now match what tasks do here. Can you inspect the skill and the current PLANNING and CLAUDE docs and unify the incoming tasks to match the general structure for daily notes level 2 (##) headings
- I know you are trying to be helpful, but you are making way too many decisions on your own and as a result you have made these skills worse in their new form. You created an importance/urgency scale. That is ok, but causes cognitive clutter. What is urgent is time sensitive and when you saw a date (e.g. ⏳ 2025-12-20) you simply ignored it. [[expect]] was a way to easily find all of the things I am waiting for. Follow up: is equivalent but doesn't collect things together. Maybe you have another plan in mind? "[[expect]] [[Brian]] to do x, y z" is very readable and findable visually. I am not grousing here, but I am seriously considering whether things are getting easier or harder to keep track of what I did and what I need to do in my business
- yes to all three
- Let's discuss whether I should use [[expect]] or #expect
- ok. good points. What I would actually want is not to see everything I am expecting in one place. That can be done in any note with the right dataview. What I do want is to see everything I am expecting for the current note. So if I am in Peerloop note, then I see what is expected for that project. I had this working in the old Obsidian Vault (you saw it is every note as dataview clutter) and so it is clutter. Better would be that I ask for such a report ("what am I expecting in the PeerLoop project?") and you respond accordingly. No clutter in every record. SO the question is: what embeddings of text will you find easiest when you go to answer such a question from me?
- yes, lock it in
- now update PLANNING.md to match
- /q-learn-decide
- /q-dump
