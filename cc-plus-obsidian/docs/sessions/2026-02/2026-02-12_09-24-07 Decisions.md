# Session Decisions - 2026-02-12

## 1. Comms Skills Migrated from Comm-Helpers
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** cc-skills, comms-skills, migration

**Trigger:** Comms skills (`/r-slack`, `/r-email`, `/r-otter`) and their reference files lived in `~/MyResearch/Comm-Helpers/.claude/commands/` with `r-` prefix, separate from the `cco-` vault skills.

**Options Considered:**
1. Leave them in Comm-Helpers, invoke from there
2. Copy to `~/.claude/commands/` with `cco-` prefix, adapt to project conventions ← Chosen

**Decision:** Migrated 5 files: `cco-slack`, `cco-email`, `cco-otter`, `cco-slack-reference`, `cco-email-reference`. Updated all internal cross-references.

**Rationale:** Global `cco-` prefix makes all vault skills available from any project. Consistent naming. Single location for maintenance.

**Consequences:** Updated DECISIONS.md skill list, PLANNING.md card type references, and "format may evolve" notes now removed.

## 2. `[[expect]]` Wikilink for Watching-For Tasks
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** task-management, wikilinks, obsidian

**Trigger:** Needed to decide how to track "things I'm waiting for others to do" after dropping Obsidian Tasks plugin format. Previous session had `[[expect]]` but it wasn't deliberated as a choice.

**Options Considered:**
1. `[[expect]]` wikilink — backlink collection, reads as English, clickable ← Chosen
2. `#expect` tag — tag pane, hierarchy support (`#expect/brian`), no graph noise
3. Plain text prefix ("Follow up:") — no collection mechanism

**Decision:** Use `[[expect]]` wikilink. Format: `- [ ] [[expect]] [[Person]] to do X`.

**Rationale:** Reads naturally as a sentence. Creates a backlink collection point — CC can grep for `[[expect]]` to answer "what am I waiting for?" queries. Tag hierarchy (`#expect/brian`) would duplicate person info already in wikilinks. Both are equally greppable by CC, so retrieval workflow is not a differentiator. No Dataview dashboard needed in the `expect` note — CC answers these queries on demand.

**Consequences:** All three comms skills updated. DECISIONS.md and PLANNING.md updated. The `expect` note in the vault can remain empty or be created when needed.

## 3. `[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]` for Explicit Deadlines
**Type:** Implementation
**Topics:** task-management, inline-fields

**Trigger:** Dropping `⏳ YYYY-MM-DD` (Tasks plugin emoji) initially lost deadline information entirely.

**Options Considered:**
1. Drop dates entirely (original mistake)
2. Parenthetical text: `(by 2025-12-20)`
3. Inline field: `[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]` ← Chosen

**Decision:** Use `[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]` inline field when a deadline is explicitly mentioned. Optional — only when there's a real deadline.

**Rationale:** Queryable by Dataview. Consistent with `[importance:: N]` inline field convention. Preserves the date as structured data rather than prose.

**Consequences:** All three comms skills updated. PLANNING.md task file example updated.

## 4. Skill-Generated Tasks Are Plain Checkboxes
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** task-management, cc-skills

**Trigger:** CC added `[importance:: N]` to every skill-generated task, creating cognitive clutter.

**Options Considered:**
1. Add `[importance:: N]` to all tasks (CC assigns importance) ← Rejected
2. Plain `- [ ]` for skill-generated tasks, `+` notation for human tasks only ← Chosen

**Decision:** Skills produce plain `- [ ]` checkboxes with no importance rating. `[importance::]` appears only in task files after `/cco-process-daily` converts human-authored `+` symbols.

**Rationale:** Importance is a human editorial judgment. Auto-assigning it to every task forces the user to evaluate correctness rather than just scanning. Keep skill output clean.

**Consequences:** All three comms skills updated. PLANNING.md Task Conventions section rewritten. Earlier session's decision 8 refined (was "use `[importance:: N]`" — now scoped to human tasks only).
