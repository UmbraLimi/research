# Session Decisions - 2026-02-12

## 1. Unified Timecard Heading Format
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** daily-notes, timecard-format, cco-process-daily

**Trigger:** Multiple inconsistent heading formats across card types (different icons, different prefixes like `Timecard •`, different structures) made parsing fragile and skill development complex.

**Options Considered:**
1. Keep per-type heading formats (different icon, label, structure per card type)
2. Unified format: `### 🕒 {CardType} • {start}` with single regex ← Chosen

**Decision:** All timecard headings in daily notes follow `### 🕒 {CardType} • {start}`. The regex `### 🕒 (.+?) • (\d{2}:\d{2})` matches all types.

**Rationale:** One parsing pattern for `/cco-process-daily`. Card type name in the heading is human-readable and machine-parseable. Clock emoji kept solely as regex anchor.

**Consequences:** Updated PLANNING.md daily note format, `/cco-meeting` skill, and all existing daily notes. Comms skills will be aligned when migrated.

## 2. Drop Type-Specific Icons from Timecard Headings
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** daily-notes, timecard-format

**Trigger:** Icons (👥, 📞, 🏗️, 💬, 📧) added visual noise and created special cases in skill logic.

**Options Considered:**
1. Keep type icons (👥 Meeting, 📞 Phone Call, etc.)
2. Drop all type icons, keep only 🕒 for regex ← Chosen

**Decision:** No type-specific icons in timecard headings. Only 🕒 remains as the regex anchor. The card type name does the distinguishing.

**Rationale:** Fewer special cases in skill and parser logic. Card type name is sufficient for visual scanning.

**Consequences:** Heading format simplified. `/cco-meeting` skill no longer needs icon lookup table.

---

## 3. Body Sections at `####` Level
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** daily-notes, heading-hierarchy, cco-process-daily

**Trigger:** Body sections (Discussion, Tasks, etc.) were at `##` level — same as qualifying headings — which would confuse `/cco-process-daily` about content boundaries.

**Options Considered:**
1. Keep `##` for body sections (flat structure)
2. Use `####` for body sections to nest under `###` timecard ← Chosen

**Decision:** All body sections within a timecard use `####`. Hierarchy: `## qualifying → ### timecard → #### body sections`.

**Rationale:** `/cco-process-daily` needs heading levels to determine which content belongs to which timecard. The hierarchy makes parsing unambiguous.

**Consequences:** Updated all card type specs in PLANNING.md. Fixed existing daily notes (2026-02-11, 2026-02-12). Existing comms skills already used `####` — no change needed there.

---

## 4. Seven Card Type Labels in Daily Note Headings
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** daily-notes, card-types

**Trigger:** Needed to define the complete set of card type labels for the unified heading format.

**Options Considered:**
1. Six labels matching card `type:` values (meeting, non-coding, slack, email, telegram, coding)
2. Seven labels with Phone Call and Site Visit as separate heading labels that map to `type: meeting` ← Chosen

**Decision:** Seven heading labels: Meeting, Phone Call, Site Visit, Non-Coding, Slack, Email, Telegram. Phone Call and Site Visit map to card `type: meeting` with `via` derived from the heading by `/cco-process-daily`.

**Rationale:** Phone Call and Site Visit are visually distinct in daily notes, but don't need separate card schemas. The `via` field in the card note captures the distinction.

**Consequences:** `/cco-process-daily` must map heading labels to card types: `Phone Call → type: meeting, via: Phone`, `Site Visit → type: meeting, via: Site Visit`.

---

## 5. Otter Transcripts Are Body Sections, Not Separate Cards
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** daily-notes, otter, meetings

**Trigger:** Needed to determine where `/r-otter` output goes in the daily note hierarchy.

**Options Considered:**
1. Otter transcript as a separate `###` timecard
2. Otter transcript as `#### Transcript` body section inside a meeting timecard ← Chosen

**Decision:** `/r-otter` output goes inside an existing meeting timecard as `#### Transcript`. It is invoked manually when the meeting's `record` field is filled in.

**Rationale:** A transcript is metadata about a meeting, not a separate work event. Keeping it inside the meeting timecard maintains the one-to-one relationship.

**Consequences:** `/r-otter` must be adapted to output at `####` level when migrated.

---

## 6. Add `bill` Field to Meeting Card Schema
**Type:** Implementation
**Topics:** meeting-card, schema

**Trigger:** Meeting card spec in PLANNING.md lacked billing support, while coding cards already had `bill` field.

**Options Considered:**
1. No billing on meeting cards
2. Add `bill` field, same pattern as coding (`Block-04` or `"No"`) ← Chosen

**Decision:** Meeting cards include `bill` field. Values: billing block reference (e.g., `Block-05`) or `No` for non-billable.

**Rationale:** Meetings can be billable. Consistent with coding card pattern.

**Consequences:** Updated meeting card spec in PLANNING.md. `/cco-meeting` skill includes `Bill?` field with default `No`.

---

## 7. `/cco-meeting` Skill Created
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** cc-skills, meeting-entry

**Trigger:** Meeting entry in daily notes had too much friction — CC asked too many questions, forgot fields, wasn't consistent across sessions.

**Options Considered:**
1. One-liner convention (no skill, rely on CC memory)
2. Obsidian Templater templates (user self-service)
3. `/cco-meeting` skill invoked by CC after parsing user's one-liner ← Chosen

**Decision:** Created `/cco-meeting` as a CC-invoked skill. User gives natural language → CC parses to structured key=value args → skill enforces rigid skeleton output. Covers Meeting, Phone Call, Site Visit.

**Rationale:** Skills enforce consistency across sessions. Separates fuzzy parsing (CC strength) from rigid output (skill enforcement).

**Consequences:** New file at `~/.claude/commands/cco-meeting.md`. Added to CLAUDE.md skill table. Does NOT cover Slack/Email/Telegram — those have their own comms skills.

---

## 8. Drop Obsidian Tasks Plugin Format
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** task-management, obsidian-plugins

**Trigger:** Existing comms skills used `🔺`, `⏳ YYYY-MM-DD`, `[[expect]]` from the Obsidian Tasks plugin. PLANNING.md uses `[importance:: N]` inline fields. Needed to standardize.

**Options Considered:**
1. Keep Tasks plugin format (`🔺`, `⏳`)
2. Use `[importance:: N]` inline fields, drop Tasks plugin ← Chosen

**Decision:** Drop Obsidian Tasks plugin format. Use `[importance:: N]` inline fields for importance. `[[expect]]` pattern for tracking others' commitments stays (it's not plugin-dependent).

**Rationale:** Tasks plugin was a dependency that added complexity. Inline fields work with Dataview and are simpler.

**Consequences:** Comms skills will need task format updated when migrated. `/cco-meeting` skeletons use plain `- [ ]` format.

---

## 9. Comms Skills Stay Separate from `/cco-meeting`
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** cc-skills, comms-skills

**Trigger:** Considered whether to merge `/r-slack`, `/r-email`, `/r-otter` into a unified `/cco-timecard` skill.

**Options Considered:**
1. Merge all card entry into one skill
2. Keep comms skills separate — different input paths, different purposes ← Chosen

**Decision:** `/cco-meeting` handles one-liner → skeleton (quick entry). `/r-slack`, `/r-email`, `/r-otter` handle screenshot/transcript → rich extraction. They will be migrated to `cco-` prefix and adapted, but remain separate skills.

**Rationale:** Different input types (natural language vs screenshots vs transcript files) require different processing. Merging would create a bloated skill with too many branches.

**Consequences:** Comms skills will be migrated from `~/MyResearch/Comm-Helpers/` and adapted to the new vault conventions when ready.

---

## 10. Daily Note Is the Working Surface, Not Final Output
**Type:** Strategic
**Topics:** daily-notes, workflow, cco-process-daily

**Trigger:** User clarified that the heading and content may be manually augmented after the skill writes the skeleton, so there should be no shortcut from one-liner directly to card note.

**Decision:** `/cco-meeting` writes to the daily note only. The user edits freely. `/cco-process-daily` extracts into card notes later. Two-step workflow: skeleton → human editing → extraction.

**Rationale:** Daily notes are the human capture surface. Users change headings, add content, restructure. Card notes are the structured output for reports and exports — generated only when the user runs `/cco-process-daily`.

**Consequences:** `/cco-meeting` skill never touches `log/`. All intelligence about field mapping and card routing lives in `/cco-process-daily`.
