# Start Conversation

**Purpose:** Verify the repo is clean, sync from remote, increment the conversation counter, push the new counter, transfer any pending tasks from RESUME-STATE.md into TodoWrite, lock the conv number for this conversation, then present resumption context. This is the **only** entry point for all conversations — both cold starts and warm restarts after `/r-end` → `/clear`.

---

## Pre-computed Context

**Machine:**
!`cat ~/.claude/.machine-name 2>/dev/null || echo "(unknown)"`

**Project prefix:**
!`grep '^prefix:' PROJECT.yaml | awk '{print $2}'`

**Current CONV-COUNTER value (before increment):**
!`.claude/scripts/conv-read-counter.sh`

**Existing .conv-current:**
!`test -f .conv-current && echo "WARNING: .conv-current already exists (value: $(cat .conv-current)) — a previous conv may not have ended cleanly" || echo "(none — clean state)"`

**Repo status:**
!`git status --short 2>/dev/null || echo "(unavailable)"`

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Check repo for uncommitted changes

Use the pre-computed repo status above. If the repo shows uncommitted changes:

```
⚠️  Uncommitted changes detected — cannot start cleanly.

Repo status:
[status output]

Options:
1. Commit changes first (run /r-commit)
2. Stash changes and proceed
3. Discard changes (destructive!)
```

**HALT** and wait for user decision. Do not proceed with a dirty repo.

### Step 2: Pull latest from remote

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

If this fails (diverged branches, network error), **HALT** and tell the user. Do not proceed — the conv counter will be out of sync.

### Step 3: Read and increment the counter

Read `CONV-COUNTER`. It contains a single integer (e.g. `4`).

Compute the next value: current + 1.

Format as zero-padded 3-digit string (e.g. `005`).

### Step 4: Write the new counter and lock it

Write the new integer (unpadded) to `CONV-COUNTER`:

```bash
echo {NEW_VALUE} > CONV-COUNTER
```

Write the zero-padded value to `.conv-current`:

```bash
echo {PADDED_VALUE} > .conv-current
```

### Step 5: Commit and push the counter

```bash
git add CONV-COUNTER
git commit -m "{PREFIX}-{PADDED_VALUE} start — {MACHINE}"
git push
```

If the push fails, **HALT** and tell the user. The counter increment is not synced until pushed.

### Step 6: Display conversation header

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════╗
║  {PREFIX}-{PADDED_VALUE}  ·  {MACHINE}  ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Step 7: Transfer outstanding tasks to TodoWrite

If `RESUME-STATE.md` exists and has a `## Remaining` section with unchecked items (`- [ ]`):

1. Extract each unchecked item from the Remaining section
2. Create a TodoWrite (TaskCreate) entry for each one, using:
   - **subject:** The item text (trimmed, without the checkbox prefix)
   - **description:** Include any sub-heading context (e.g., "Bug Fix (carried from PRH-010)") and the source: "From RESUME-STATE.md"
3. Display a brief summary:

```
📋 Transferred {N} outstanding tasks from RESUME-STATE.md to TodoWrite:
- [item 1]
- [item 2]
...
```

4. After successful transfer, delete `RESUME-STATE.md` — the items now live in TodoWrite for this conversation, and the historical state is preserved in git history.

```
🗑️  Deleted RESUME-STATE.md (tasks transferred to TodoWrite)
```

If RESUME-STATE.md doesn't exist or has no unchecked items, skip silently. If it exists but all items are already checked (`[x]`), delete it with a note that all items are done.

### Step 8: Resume work context

Invoke `/r-resume` via the Skill tool to present the current work position and recommended next action.

## Rules

- **HALT on dirty repo** — never proceed with uncommitted changes
- **HALT on pull failure** — never increment without a successful pull
- **HALT on push failure** — the counter must be pushed before any work begins
- If `.conv-current` already exists, warn the user (prior conv didn't run `/r-end`) but proceed — the counter in `CONV-COUNTER` (post-pull) is the source of truth
- The `CONV-COUNTER` file stores an unpadded integer; `.conv-current` stores a zero-padded 3-digit string
- Do NOT begin any project work until Steps 1–7 are complete
