# End-of-Session Sequence

Runs the 4-skill end-of-session workflow in order. Each skill is invoked via the Skill tool.

**Do NOT skip or reorder steps.** Run each to completion before starting the next.

---

## Shared Timestamp

All session files created by this run share a single timestamp, pre-computed here:

!`echo "MONTH: $(date '+%Y-%m')" && echo "FILENAME: $(date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M')"`

**Pass these values as arguments** to `/r-learn-decide` and `/r-dump` so all session files match.

---

## Sequence

### Step 1: `/r-learn-decide`

Capture session learnings and decisions.

**Run:** Invoke `/r-learn-decide` via the Skill tool with args `{MONTH} {FILENAME}`. Complete it fully.

### Step 2: `/r-dump`

Create the development session log.

**Run:** Invoke `/r-dump` via the Skill tool with args `{MONTH} {FILENAME}`. Complete it fully.

### Step 3: `/r-update-plan`

Update PLAN.md with current progress.

**Run:** Invoke `/r-update-plan` via the Skill tool and complete it fully.

### Step 4: `/r-docs`

Update all project documentation.

**Run:** Invoke `/r-docs` via the Skill tool and complete it fully.

---

## Rules

- Run skills **sequentially** — each must finish before starting the next
- If a skill asks the user a question, wait for their answer before continuing
- After all 4 complete, display a summary:

```
End-of-Session Complete
───────────────────────
1. Learn/Decide  ✅
2. Session Dump   ✅
3. Plan Update    ✅
4. Docs Update    ✅
```

- Do NOT automatically commit or push — the user will run `/r-commit` separately if needed
