# Session Learnings - 2025-11-29

## Workflow & Organization

- **Claude Code slash command discovery**: Commands are found in exactly two locations:
  1. `.claude/commands/` in the working directory where Claude is launched
  2. `~/.claude/commands/` for user-level commands available everywhere
  - No parent directory traversal - subfolder commands won't be found from parent
  - Must restart Claude Code to pick up newly added commands

- **Multi-project research repo strategy**:
  - Keep git repo at top level (`MyResearch/`)
  - Each research project in a subfolder (`Alpha-Peer/`, etc.)
  - Generic session commands (`/q-*`) go in `~/.claude/commands/` for reuse across projects
  - Project-specific commands (`/r-*`) stay in project's `.claude/commands/`
  - Launch Claude from project subfolder, not repo root

- **Minimum project template**: Created `Minimum-Project/` as a copyable template containing:
  - `PLAN.md` - required for `/q-resume` and `/q-update`
  - `CLAUDE.md` - project guidance
  - `docs/sessions/` - for learnings and prompts
  - `.claude/commands/` - for project-specific commands
  - `README.md` - setup instructions

## Command Cleanup

- Removed conflicting `/r-*` commands that duplicated `/q-*` functionality:
  - `/r-end-session` (use `/q-end-session`)
  - `/r-start-session` (use `/q-resume`)
  - `/r-capture-learning` (use `/q-learnings`)
  - `/r-help` (redundant with CLAUDE.md)

- Kept unique `/r-*` commands for research workflows:
  - `/r-research-tech`, `/r-compare-tech`, `/r-create-story`
  - `/r-update-needs`, `/r-log-decision`, `/r-add-client-doc`
  - `/r-status`, `/r-review`, `/r-sync-structure`, `/r-list`
