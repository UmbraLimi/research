# Session Learnings - 2025-11-30

## Session Focus
Batch processing of client documents (CD-005 through CD-009) from Slack conversations and meeting transcripts.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Client Document Chronology Matters
- Slack messages have original dates that differ from upload dates
- Established chronological order: CD-005 (Nov 13) → CD-006 (Nov 16) → CD-007 (Nov 18) → CD-008 (Nov 26) → CD-009 (Nov 28) → CD-002 (Nov 29)
- Later documents can override or clarify earlier decisions
- Need to track "Original Date" vs "Date Uploaded" in index entries

### 2. Extracting Client Intent from Conversations
- When processing meeting transcripts, focus only on what the client (Brian) states as wants
- Ignore consultant questions/suggestions - they're not client decisions
- Brian's direct quotes are valuable for understanding rationale
- Philosophy statements ("People motivate people. Computers don't motivate people.") inform design decisions

### 3. Key Decisions Confirmed This Session
| Decision | Source | Value |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Budget | CD-008 | $75,000 |
| Timeline | CD-008 | 4 months |
| BBB Provider | CD-009 | Blindside Networks (managed hosting) |
| Hosting | CD-009 | Cloudflare (peerloop.com live) |
| Stream Scope | CD-008 | Feeds only (not video, chat low priority) |
| Feed Prototype | CD-008 | Skool.com |
| Feed Purpose | CD-008 | Marketing funnel (not just social feature) |

### 4. Video Conferencing Complexity
- Multiple options still in play: BBB, Daily.co, Digital Samba
- Key evaluation criteria identified:
  - 1:1 session optimization (P2P vs SFU)
  - Recording storage location and playback access
  - Per-session vs per-user pricing
- Hybrid approach possible: BBB for groups, P2P for 1:1

### 5. Community Feed as Marketing Funnel
- Brian's vision: Follow → Feed → Social Proof → Convert → Retain
- "Follow" happens before enrollment (exploration phase)
- Combats isolation problem in self-paced learning
- Added US-S028: "Follow creators before enrolling" as P0 story

### 6. Speed-to-Market Philosophy
- Brian's quote: "We need to cut corners where ever possible"
- Managed services preferred over self-hosting
- Blindside Networks handles BBB infrastructure
- Cloudflare free tier for initial deployment

## Process Improvements

### What Worked Well
- `/r-add-client-doc` command workflow efficient for batch processing
- Cross-referencing between Goals and User Stories tables maintains traceability
- Document chronology tracking helps resolve conflicting information

### Areas to Improve
- Consider adding "Clarification Needed" flags more prominently in index
- GetStream vs Bluesky protocol still needs resolution
- Video conferencing comparison doc (comp-002) should be created soon

## Statistics Update
- Client Docs: 4 → 9 (+5 this session)
- Goals: 17 → 18 (+1: GO-018 Budget/Timeline)
- User Stories: 150 → 151 (+1: US-S028 Follow Creators)
- P0 Stories: 77 → 78

## Open Questions Resolved
- Budget/Timeline: $75K / 4 months
- Hosting: Cloudflare confirmed
- BBB Provider: Blindside Networks
- Stream Scope: Feeds only
- Feed Prototype: Skool.com

## Next Session Priorities
1. Research Daily.co and Digital Samba
2. Create comp-002-video-conferencing.md
3. Continue gap-filling service research (payment, auth, etc.)
