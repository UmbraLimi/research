# Session Prompts - 2025-11-29

## Prompts Used This Session

1. Review the contents of @client-docs/ and review @client-docs/client-docs-index.md and determine if these documents are adequately summarized

2. You will find it in ../file_holding/ folder. Please move it to @client-docs/ and reasess.

3. Update the @client-docs/client-docs-index.md with your findings for this recently moved document

4. Files we want to examine will always be staged into the file_holding folder. Should we create a symlink so we can see them in the file/folder tree and I can reference them by name as I do for any other file in the folder?

5. yes! (to adding file_holding to .gitignore)

6. We are maintaining a sibling folder to Alpha-Peer called "Minimum-Project". It too needs the symlink and the .gitignore change. Can you do that, or shall I open that project and issue those commands to you there?
