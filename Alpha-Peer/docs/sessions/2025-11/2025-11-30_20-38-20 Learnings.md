# Session Learnings - 2025-11-30 (Session 3)

## Session Focus
Processing Miro board screenshots as client documents to capture visual planning content.

---

## Workflow Learnings

### Miro Board Export Limitations
- Miro's web interface export options may be hidden or unavailable depending on plan tier and board permissions
- **Workaround:** Screenshots work well - even partial board captures can be processed effectively
- The markdown transcription approach preserves both content and structure (cards, colors, spatial organization)

### Processing Visual Documents
- Screenshots of visual boards can be processed by:
  1. Reading the image directly (Claude can interpret visual content)
  2. Creating a markdown document that captures the structure
  3. Running `/r-add-client-doc` on the markdown file
- Color coding in visual boards (blue = activities, pink = pain points) provides semantic meaning worth preserving

## Documentation Learnings

### New Role Discovery
- **Community Moderator** emerged as a distinct role from Creator
- Role code assigned: `M` (US-M001, US-M002, etc.)
- This shows the value of processing visual planning documents - new requirements surface

### Certificate Types Clarification
- CD-011 revealed a three-tier certificate system:
  1. **Certificate of Completion** - Standard course completion
  2. **Certificate of Mastery** - Deeper understanding (separate from completion)
  3. **Teaching Certificate** - For Student-Teachers
- Previous docs mentioned "dual certificate" but this clarifies the actual distinction

### Bluesky Confirmation
- CD-011 explicitly confirms Bluesky as the community tool for all roles
- This resolves ambiguity between GetStream (feeds) and Bluesky (community)
- GetStream = algorithmic feeds; Bluesky = discussions, events, news, updates

## Technical Learnings

### Bidirectional Opt-Out Requirement
- Both Students AND Teacher Students need ability to exit relationships
- This is a workflow consideration for the matching system
- New stories added: US-S034 (student opt-out), US-T014 (teacher opt-out), US-P059 (system handling)

### Gamification Expansion
- GO-019 expanded to include Teacher Student points (not just student goodwill points)
- Points system serves different purposes:
  - Students: Engagement and community standing
  - Teacher Students: Motivation and activity tracking

---

## Process Improvements

### Miro Import Workflow
- Effective pattern for future Miro imports:
  1. User takes screenshot(s) of board sections
  2. Claude reads image and creates structured markdown
  3. Markdown saved to `file_holding/`
  4. `/r-add-client-doc` processes and indexes

### Story Statistics Accuracy
- When adding stories across multiple roles, count carefully by priority level
- Update both the Statistics table AND the Current State table
- Track source document in Story Index table

## Key Discoveries This Session

1. **32 new user stories** added from 2 Miro screenshots
2. **2 new goals** (GO-019 expanded, GO-020 Credentialing System added)
3. **1 new role** (Community Moderator with US-M prefix)
4. **Bluesky confirmed** as community tool (resolves earlier ambiguity)
5. **Mastery certificate** is distinct from completion certificate
6. **BBB pricing model** is usage-based (per session) for creators
