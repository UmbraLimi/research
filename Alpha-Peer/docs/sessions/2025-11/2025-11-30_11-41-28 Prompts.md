# Session Prompts - 2025-11-30

## Session Overview
Establishing GATHER/RUN framework, directives system, and document versioning for Alpha Peer.

## Key Prompts Used

### 1. Creating Third-Party Integration Phase
> It's now time to turn our attention to 3rd party software that we will need to integrate. Create a Phase in the Plan where I list those javascript packages and 3rd-party services. From this list we will determine which user stories can be provided by these services and npm packages. Two that we know of now (just to start you off) are Big Blue Button and Stream. You will need to determine their capabilities and assess them for potentially filling the need for each user story. Both Big Blue Button and Stream have been pre-specified by my client as needing to be in the final solution, so that is very important to note: some service and npm packages are optional, some are required.

**Why useful:** Kicked off Phase 2.5 with clear distinction between required vs optional services.

---

### 2. Gap Analysis for User Stories
> We need to handle those gaps you identified in the user stories. This effort will be added to the plan (finding the services, npm packages) but for now I need you only to add whatever user stories are needed because those gaps exist

**Why useful:** Focused on documenting the need (user stories) before researching solutions. Added 48 infrastructure stories.

---

### 3. Infrastructure User Stories
> Very good. Now let us deal with infrastructure for this project. In particular database, storage for large files, image file storage and optimization. These are system-level user stories. Have we handled this in the plan and User stories yet?

**Why useful:** Specifically called out infrastructure as often-missed category. Added database, file storage, image optimization stories.

---

### 4. Scenarios Concept
> So far we have been amassing client docs and from them creating user-stories, Goals and Mission statement. We update these files with additional info as we find more client docs, more vendors software and services, or add more user stories. This is the gather phase of our work together. When I add a software/service, a client doc or a user-stories that must trigger an update to GOALS.md USER-STORIES.md and perhaps PLAN.md. We have a slash command called /r-add-client-doc when we add a client doc. We need a /r-add-software command that takes a URL, researches it, create a tech doc for it, and updates all necessary other docs. Similarly, I need a slash command /r-add-user-story where I type in the user story on the same line

**Why useful:** Defined the GATHER phase concept and need for systematic input commands.

---

### 5. GATHER vs RUN Phase Definition
> Update @CLAUDE.md to explain the "gather" phase I just described. When you are done, I will describe the "run" phase

**Why useful:** Established two-phase structure before detailing the RUN phase.

---

### 6. RUN Phase Definition
> The "run" phase involves 1) taking the static information currently available from the "gather" phase, 2) specifying an existing scenario with detailed changes, restrictions, desires, etc., and, 3) filling out the SPECS.md for that new scenario. The run consults all the gather information available, preferring later client docs over earlier ones when their information contradicts, and fills out the SPECS.md with optimal selections for software and services. Every spec will always have a large portion of custom software development. The goal is to minimize this time for custom development by utilizing software and services that already exist. To that end, Scenario 1 will ALWAYS be a completely custom solution (i.e. No Stream, no BigBlue button) but will make heavy use of Cloudflare services, Vercel services, npm packages, etc.

**Why useful:** Defined RUN phase with key principles:
- Later docs override earlier
- sc-001 as fully-custom baseline
- Goal: minimize custom dev time

---

### 7. Directives Concept
> My last concept for this session will be directives about what not to use and what to use (software, software features, software combinations, etc). I will find out, perhaps, that Software A doesn't work well with software B, or you may find the same. We may also find that the client wants to add/integrate a feature of Software C. This sort of thing. These are Learnings that you or I may contribute and they need a place to live between the Gather phase and the run phase. How can we keep track of these and ensure that the run phase consults these learnings?

**Why useful:** Identified need for DIRECTIVES.md as constraints layer between GATHER and RUN.

---

### 8. Document Versioning for Lineage
> Whenever we add a client_doc, user-story, directive or change CLAUDE.md or PLAN.md, we might be invalidating all existing scenario SPEC files. So we need a way, in each scenario SPEC at least (and perhaps elsewhere), that states a snapshot (perhaps a checksum or UUID) of each of the DIRECTIVES.md, USER-STORIES.md, GOALS.MD and CLAUDE.md from which it was developed when it was created. What are your thoughts?

**Why useful:** Established versioning system for scenario lineage tracking.

---

### 9. Including CLAUDE.md in Versioning
> Yes. But add back in the CLAUDE.md version to each scenario. That might be helpful at some later point even though it doesn't dictate the run parameters, it does give context.

**Why useful:** Refined versioning to include process context (CLAUDE.md), not just content.

---

## Prompt Patterns

### "Have we handled X yet?"
Good for checking coverage before diving into implementation.

### "For now I need you only to..."
Useful for scoping immediate work when larger task is identified.

### "What are your thoughts?"
Opens dialogue for Claude to propose solutions before implementing.

### Phase separation
Defining GATHER before RUN, getting alignment before implementation.
