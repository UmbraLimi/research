# Session Prompts - 2025-11-29

## Prompts Used (in sequence)

1. "let's examine each of the "/r-" slash commands and see if they are needed or otherwise conflict with the "/q-" commands"

2. "Yes" (to delete conflicting commands)

3. "Is it possible to have slash commands that are folder specific?"

4. "Neither. Can you explain why claude is dependant on git repos and not folders? Could I not have started cluse code in a non-git folder?"

5. "It does. Let me explain my rational. I have a git repo for reaserach. It handles all of my research which are [ractically broken out into subfolders. WHen I make a change to any of MyResearch's subfolders, I will push that to github via a commit at the MyResearch folder. This keeps me from making a multiptude of git repos, all with very few files."

6. "The q- commands are generic to any research project and as such should live in the repo's root. But the r- commands are specific to the folder and should remain there. SO I need a workflow that allows me to use but q- and r- slash commands when I am in a subfolder of MyResearch. Or I could ignore the MyResearch folder and work only with subflder Alpha-Peer and use r- commands. WHen I am done, load up MyResearch and do the q- commands. Please comment."

7. "It looks like I keep all the q- and r- commands together in Alpha-Peer. Except `q-commit` as it alone needs to be in MyResearch. Does that work?"

8. "Are you sure you (Claude Code) with find q-commit.md in the parent folder when I start you in a subfolder?"

9. "yes" (to move q-* commands to ~/.claude/commands/)

10. "We need to create a sibling folder to Alpha-Peer called Minimum-Project. In this folder we need to create the minimal folders and files needed by any new research project"

11. "Let's add a README.md file as well with instructions, caveats, suggestions, as applicable"

12. "If I exit I lose the prompts, learnings I want to document. I want to run what is inside ~/.claude/commands/q-end-session.md"
