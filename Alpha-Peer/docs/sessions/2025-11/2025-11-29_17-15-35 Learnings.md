# Session Learnings - 2025-11-29

## Documentation

- **Client docs index should match actual files**: When summarizing documents in an index, verify the referenced files actually exist in the target folder. The Feature_Summary_WIPold.pdf was indexed but hadn't been moved from file_holding.

- **PDF summaries benefit from specific UI details**: Including concrete UI elements (button names like "Switch User", "Creator Studio") and page counts makes summaries more actionable for Needs.md creation.

- **Document flexible business rules explicitly**: The 15/15/70 revenue split being "flexible per creator with platform minimum" is an important nuance that affects technical requirements.

## Workflow

- **Symlinks enable cross-project file staging**: Creating a symlink from project folders to a shared `file_holding/` staging area allows:
  - Files to appear in the project's folder tree
  - Direct `@file_holding/filename` references in Claude Code
  - Single staging location serving multiple sibling projects

- **Shared .gitignore at parent level**: When multiple project folders share resources, maintaining .gitignore at the parent `MyResearch/` level with project-prefixed paths (e.g., `Alpha-Peer/file_holding`, `Minimum-Project/file_holding`) keeps exclusions organized.

## Technical Details from Client Docs

- **"Helper Therapy Principle"**: Named pedagogical concept driving the Student-Teacher model - teaching enhances mastery.

- **Community Roles are paid positions**: Creator/Instructor assistants who manage communities have revenue sharing built in - this is a distinct role from Student-Teacher.

- **Teaching Certificates are dynamic**: They update to reflect number of students taught, not just a one-time issuance.
