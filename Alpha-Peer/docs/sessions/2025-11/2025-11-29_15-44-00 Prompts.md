# Session Prompts - 2025-11-29

## Prompts Used This Session

1. `/init` - Analyze codebase and create CLAUDE.md file

2. "I have just added a bunch of slash commands beginning with 'q-' to the .claude/commands folder. Please update CLAUDE.md and check these commands to see if they are ambiguous and could be improved"

3. "All folder references are relative to the parent folder we are in Alpha-Peer/. Therefore, update the inconsistencies in commands.md to match what the 'q-' commands use"

4. "We do not need q-dump.md and there will be no need to create the *Dev.md files as we are doing no software development here. So please update all commands"

5. "Now let us move the commands in commands.md into .claude/commands/ but prepend each command with 'r-' so as not to confuse their origins. For example, /end-session will become /r-end-session"

6. "Can we now delete the commands.md file?"

7. "Before we review all of the q- and r- slash commands, I will have to quit and restart. Before I do that, I'll need you to put down the basis for a PLAN.md as many slash commands require one."

8. "execute the q-end-session.md slash command"
