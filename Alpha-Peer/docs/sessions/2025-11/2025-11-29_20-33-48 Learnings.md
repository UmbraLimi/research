# Session Learnings - 2025-11-29

## Session Focus
Client document processing, creating structured project documentation (GOALS.md, USER-STORIES.md), and establishing consistent numbering conventions.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Processed 2 New Client Documents
- **CD-003:** Alpha Peer User Stories (Nov 29 2025) - Working-level user stories across 6 roles
- **CD-004:** The Impact Filter Mission Statement - Strategic planning with quantified success metrics

### 2. Created GOALS.md
- Extracted 17 goals (GO-001 through GO-017) from all 4 client documents
- Organized into categories: Strategic, MVP Launch, Success Metrics, Platform Capabilities, Quality, Long-Term Vision
- Added source traceability (CD-NNN references)

### 3. Created USER-STORIES.md
- Compiled 105 user stories from all 4 client documents
- Organized by role: Admin (23), Creator (23), Student (27), Student-Teacher (13), Employer (6), Session (7), Platform (6)
- Assigned priorities: P0 (48), P1 (42), P2 (15)

### 4. Established Numbering Conventions
- **Client Documents:** CD-NNN (CD-001 through CD-004, next: CD-005)
- **Goals:** GO-NNN (supports up to 999)
- **User Stories:** US-[Role]NNN where Role = A/C/S/T/E/V/P (supports 999 per role)

### 5. Renamed Needs.md to SPECS.md
- Updated all references across project files
- Renamed `/r-update-needs` to `/r-update-specs`

### 6. Updated /r-add-client-doc Workflow
- Now automatically updates: client-docs-index.md, GOALS.md, USER-STORIES.md, STRUCTURE.md
- Includes CD-NNN assignment, GO-NNN numbering, US-[Role]NNN numbering

## Key Insights

### Document Cross-Referencing
Using consistent ID prefixes (CD-, GO-, US-) enables traceability across documents. Any requirement can be traced back to its source client document.

### Numbering for Scale
Zero-padded 3-digit numbers (NNN) provide:
- Room for growth (up to 999 per category)
- Consistent sorting
- Easy visual scanning

### Role-Based Story Organization
Using single-letter role codes (A, C, S, T, E, V, P) in story IDs allows:
- Quick identification of story scope
- Independent numbering per role
- 999 stories per role = 6,993 total capacity

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `GOALS.md` - Mission statement and 17 goals
- `USER-STORIES.md` - 105 user stories
- `docs/sessions/2025-11/2025-11-29_20-33-48 Learnings.md` (this file)

### Modified
- `client-docs-index.md` - Added CD-003, CD-004, CD numbering, quick reference table
- `STRUCTURE.md` - Added GOALS.md, USER-STORIES.md, numbering conventions, current state table
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated repository structure, renamed Needs.md references
- `SPECS.md` - Renamed from Needs.md, updated title
- `.claude/commands/r-add-client-doc.md` - Comprehensive update workflow
- `.claude/commands/r-update-specs.md` - Renamed from r-update-needs.md

## Next Steps
1. Begin technology research based on SPECS.md requirements
2. Create detailed user story files for P0 stories
3. Start architecture decisions based on tech stack from CD-002
