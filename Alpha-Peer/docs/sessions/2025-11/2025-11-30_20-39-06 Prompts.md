# Session Prompts - 2025-11-30 (Session 3)

## Session Focus
Processing Miro board screenshots as client documents

---

## User Prompts (in sequence)

### 1. Miro Export Question
> A Miro board was created (and I have access to it) that has a lot of useful considerations for the Peer Loop app we will eventually build. I took a few screenshots, but the miro board is wide and I would have to string together many screenshots to recreate it. Have you any suggestions so that I can get the visual content of a Miro board to you to analyze as a client doc

*Context: User asking for help with Miro board export options*

### 2. Miro Menu Screenshot
> [Screenshot of Miro 3-dot menu]
> Here is the contents of the 3-dot menu I see

*Context: User showing that export options weren't visible in their Miro interface*

### 3. First Miro Board Screenshot + Processing Request
> I can give you a screenshot of a section of the Miro board. It represents the Main Activities as seen from students, then teacher students, the course creators, then platform admin, new a new role: moderator. Treat this screenshot as a single unit and create a document (.md) and then run /r-add-client-doc
> [Screenshot of Miro board - Main Activities by Role]

*Context: User providing first Miro screenshot with instructions to process it as a client document*

### 4. Second Miro Board Screenshot + Processing Request
> This next screenshot has 2 rows "Drivers" and "Action Items" and applies to the first 3 columns as the first screenshot, namely "Students", "Teacher Students" and "Course Creators". Create a document from this screenshot and run /r-add-client-doc
> [Screenshot of Miro board - Drivers & Action Items]

*Context: User providing second Miro screenshot for processing*

### 5. Update Plan
> /gr-update

*Context: User requesting PLAN.md update with session progress*

### 6. End Session
> /gr-end-session

*Context: User initiating end-of-session workflow*

## Notable Patterns

- **Screenshot + Instructions Pattern**: User provides visual content with explicit processing instructions
- **Incremental Processing**: User broke large Miro board into logical sections for sequential processing
- **Slash Command Usage**: User leveraged `/r-add-client-doc` and session management commands effectively

## Reusable Prompts

### For Processing Visual Boards
```
I can give you a screenshot of a section of the [BOARD_NAME]. It represents [DESCRIPTION_OF_CONTENT]. Treat this screenshot as a single unit and create a document (.md) and then run /r-add-client-doc
```

### For Related Screenshots
```
This next screenshot has [ROWS/SECTIONS] and applies to [RELATIONSHIP_TO_PREVIOUS]. Create a document from this screenshot and run /r-add-client-doc
```
