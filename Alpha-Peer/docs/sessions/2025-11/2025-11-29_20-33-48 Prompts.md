# Session Prompts - 2025-11-29

## Prompts Used This Session

### 1. Process Client Documents
```
@"client-docs/Alpha Peer User Stories • Nov 29 2025.pdf" /r-add-client-doc
```
```
@"client-docs/The Impact Filter 110425 Mission Statement.pdf" /r-add-client-doc
```

### 2. Create GOALS.md
```
There are now 4 client documents we have summarized. I'd like you to create a GOALS.md file and populate it with a Mission Statements and as many goals as you can find. Each time we add a new document, I will want you to update the GOALS.MD so you should update @.claude/commands/r-add-client-doc.md as well
```

### 3. Create USER-STORIES.md
```
In a similar way, our 4 client documents should be enough to create a starting USER-STORIES.md where we list all of the user stories which follow from 1) user stories entered in the docs, 2) implied functionality from GOALS.md, and 3) specific mockups and wording found anywhere in the client docs. We should also update @.claude/commands/r-add-client-doc.md to reflect that new documents should be scanned for user stories and added to USER-STORIES.md
```

### 4. Rename Needs.md to SPECS.md
```
@Needs.md should be renamed to SPECS.md and any references updated
```

### 5. Add CD Numbering Convention
```
Client Docs should be given sequential numbers following the "CD" prefix. E.g. CD-001. We may need to reference client docs elsewhere in the project
```

### 6. Expand Numbering to 999
```
You have done a comprehensive job with the client docs. And I see that you have extended the concept into the Goals and User Stories. Have you provided for up to 999 goals and 999 user stories? For example US-NNN and GO-NNN. User Stories have roles so see what you can do to follow your system but allow expansion to 999 instances of each
```

### 7. Update PLAN.md
```
Let's update @PLAN with whatever steps you think are appropriate given how we have progressed this session
```

## Reusable Patterns

### Pattern: Create Tracking Document from Client Docs
1. Read all client documents from index
2. Extract relevant items (goals, stories, requirements)
3. Assign sequential IDs with consistent prefix
4. Create source traceability table
5. Add "Current State" section for next numbers
6. Update /r-add-client-doc to maintain document

### Pattern: Establish Numbering Convention
1. Choose prefix (2-3 chars, e.g., CD, GO, US)
2. Use zero-padded 3 digits (NNN) for 999 capacity
3. Add "Next Number" tracking in relevant files
4. Document convention in STRUCTURE.md
5. Update slash commands with numbering instructions
