# Session Prompts - 2025-11-30

## Useful Prompts from This Session

### 1. Processing Meeting Transcripts
When given a raw meeting transcript:
> "See if you can understand it. What I want you to summarize is not what [consultant] says, but what [client] states as his wants. [Consultant] merely asks questions or makes statements but it is what [client] thinks that matters."

This prompt effectively filters meeting content to extract only client decisions and preferences.

### 2. Adding Video Evaluation Criteria
> "Add to our plan when evaluating video software for video conferencing to pay special attention to our prevalent situation of one:one tutoring and what each software package can do about recording a session and playing it back to each participant. We need to know where the recording is stored and how it can be played back."

This prompt added specific evaluation criteria to PLAN.md for video service research.

### 3. Batch Client Doc Processing
> "Here is a Slack post from the client from [date]. Turn this into a document (as you have done before) and run /r-add-client-doc"

Standard pattern for converting raw Slack messages to client docs:
1. Create CD-NNN file with original message
2. Add summary section
3. Run /r-add-client-doc to index and cross-reference

### 4. Client Doc Structure Template
Documents followed this structure:
```markdown
# CD-NNN: [Title]

**Source:** Slack message from client
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Added:** YYYY-MM-DD

---

## Original Message

> [Quoted original text]

---

## Summary for SPECS.md

[Analysis of key elements, technical implications, relationships to other docs]
```

## Command Patterns Used

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `/r-add-client-doc @path` | Process and index client document |
| `/gr-update` | Update PLAN.md with session progress |
| `/gr-end-session` | End session workflow |

## Effective Techniques

1. **Quote extraction** - Capturing exact client quotes preserves intent
2. **Chronology tracking** - "Original Date" vs "Date Uploaded" distinction
3. **Cross-referencing** - Linking docs to Goals (GO-NNN) and Stories (US-XNNN)
4. **Clarification flags** - Marking open questions with ⚠️ emoji
