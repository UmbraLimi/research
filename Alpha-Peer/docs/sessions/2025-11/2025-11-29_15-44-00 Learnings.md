# Session Learnings - 2025-11-29

## Documentation & Structure

- Created CLAUDE.md to provide guidance to future Claude Code instances
- Established folder structure convention: `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM/` for session files
- Session files use timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS [Type].md`
- Two session file types: `Learnings.md` and `Prompts.md` (no Dev.md needed for research projects)

## Command System

- Migrated conversational commands from `prompts/commands.md` to native Claude Code slash commands
- Two command prefixes established:
  - `/q-*` - Session & git commands (originally created for development workflows)
  - `/r-*` - Research & documentation commands (migrated from commands.md)
- Deleted `/q-dump` command as Dev.md files not needed for research-only projects

## Workflow Insights

- `file_holding/` serves as temporary staging area for files before processing
- Client docs should be read-only - reference but don't modify originals
- STRUCTURE.md is the master guide - always check it before creating numbered files
- PLAN.md structure supports `/q-resume` and `/q-update` commands with phase markers (🔥 WIP, 📋 NEXT, 🏁 LATEST COMPLETE, ✅ ARCHIVED)

## Files Created This Session

- `/CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code guidance file
- `/Alpha-Peer/PLAN.md` - Research & planning roadmap
- `/Alpha-Peer/.claude/commands/r-*.md` - 14 research command files
- Updated `/Alpha-Peer/STRUCTURE.md` with new session folder structure
