# Session Prompts - 2025-12-04

## User Prompts (in sequence)

*Note: This session was continued from a previous context. Prompts from prior sessions included `/r-add-client-doc` commands for CD-018, CD-019, and CD-020.*

### 1. User Type Inquiry
```
Based on our work so far, can you list the user types we now have and whether we have a user who is not registered, like a visitor or a guest?
```

### 2. Visitor Role Creation Request
```
I would like you to create a 'Visitor' or non-logged in user type and come up with user-stories for them. Ideally, this visitor should be able to view teachers, courses but not registered users. They should be able to see promotional content available from the home page. A visitor is the capabilities of everyone who lands on the home page. They are able to login or sign up and view promotional content pages to give them a feel for what the site offers
```

### 3. Plan Mode Responses (via AskUserQuestion)
- Selected "V" for prefix initially
- Selected "Yes - P0 for core stories" for priority
- Selected "Use 'G' instead" when V prefix conflict was identified

### 4. Update Documentation
```
/gr-update
```

### 5. End Session
```
/gr-end-session
```

## Notable Prompt Patterns

### Gap Analysis Pattern
The user identified a gap (missing Visitor role) by asking Claude to list current state, then requested creation of stories to fill that gap. This is an effective pattern for discovering missing requirements.

### Capability-Based Story Request
The user defined the role by its capabilities:
- Can view: teachers, courses, promotional content
- Cannot view: registered users
- Can do: login, sign up
- Context: "everyone who lands on the home page"

This capability-based framing produced clear, actionable user stories.
