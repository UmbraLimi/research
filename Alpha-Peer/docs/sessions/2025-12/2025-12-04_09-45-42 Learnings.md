# Session Learnings - 2025-12-04

## Planning & Architecture

- **PAGES.md as intermediate artifact**: Adding a page-level architecture document between user stories and SPECS.md scenarios helps bridge the gap between requirements and implementation. It maps user stories to actual pages, establishing navigation patterns and access controls before scenario generation.

- **Page codes for cross-referencing**: Using 3-5 letter codes (e.g., SDASH, TPROF) makes it easy to reference page connections without lengthy descriptions. Similar to how we use GO-NNN for goals and US-*NNN for user stories.

- **Multi-role users require special UX consideration**: Users can hold multiple roles simultaneously (Student + Student-Teacher + Creator). Dashboards and other pages need to accommodate this through:
  - Sidebar sections per role
  - Tabbed/sectioned layouts
  - Conditional widgets
  - Role-switching vs role-aggregation UX patterns

## Workflow

- **Preparation tasks while waiting**: When blocked waiting for external inputs (client docs), there's valuable prep work that can be done:
  - Pre-research known decision points (video conferencing options)
  - Draft templates and structures (PAGES.md skeleton)
  - Review and audit existing content (user stories)
  - Draft non-functional requirements from known constraints

- **Phase placement matters**: PAGES.md belongs in RUN phase (not GATHER) because it requires all gathered information to be complete before meaningful page architecture can be created. It's a synthesis step, not a collection step.

## Documentation Structure

- **Phase numbering adjustment**: When inserting new phases, renumber subsequent phases to maintain logical flow:
  - Phase 3: Page Architecture (PAGES.md) - NEW
  - Phase 4: Scenario Creation (was Phase 3)
  - Phase 5: Final Selection & Handoff (was Phase 4)
