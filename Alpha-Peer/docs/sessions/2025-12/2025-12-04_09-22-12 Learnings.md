# Session Learnings - 2025-12-04

## Session Focus
Continued processing MVP decision client documents (CD-018 through CD-020) and created a new Visitor/Guest user role with associated user stories.

---

## Documentation & User Stories

### 1. Visitor/Guest Role Pattern
- Non-logged in users need explicit representation in user stories
- Created US-G prefix (G for Guest) to avoid conflict with US-V (Video/Session)
- 15 stories covering: homepage viewing, course discovery, creator/teacher discovery, authentication actions, and access restrictions
- Most visitor stories are P0 since they represent the first touchpoint for all potential users

### 2. User Story Prefix Conflict Resolution
- When proposing a new role prefix, always check existing prefixes first
- Initial "V" for Visitor conflicted with existing "V" for Video/Session stories
- Solution: Use "G" for Guest instead - clearer and avoids ambiguity

### 3. Story Statistics Cascade
- Adding a new role requires updates in 6 places within USER-STORIES.md:
  1. User Roles table
  2. New section with stories
  3. Story Statistics table (add row + update totals)
  4. Story Index by Source Document
  5. Current State table (with next number)
  6. Notes for Implementation (P0 count)
- Also update Story Format section to include new prefix in the legend

## MVP Feature Insights

### 4. Budget Allocation Patterns (from CD-017 through CD-020)
| Feature | Budget | Timeline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Creator Profiles | $8K-11K | 2-3 weeks |
| Student Profiles | $14K-18.7K | 3-4 weeks |
| Course Content Delivery | $2K-4K | ~1 week |
| Payment & Escrow | $11K-15K | 2-3 weeks |

- Total for these 4 features: $35K-48.7K of $75K budget (47-65%)
- Semi-automated approaches save significant development cost

### 5. Operational Model Clarification (from CD-019)
- Creator controls: certifications, payouts, new Student-Teachers
- Platform (Brian): strategic oversight only, ~3-4 hrs/week
- This principle should inform all feature designs

### 6. Payment System Architecture (from CD-020)
- Semi-automated payout saves $5K-$11K vs fully automated Stripe Connect
- Stripe Checkout for collection, manual button click for payouts
- 70/15/15 split (Student-Teacher/Creator/Platform) is core to flywheel validation

## Process Learnings

### 7. Context Continuity
- Session was continued from previous context that ran out
- Plan file at `~/.claude/plans/scalable-launching-forest.md` preserved task state
- Todo list preserved in-progress status for seamless resumption

### 8. PLAN.md Currency
- PLAN.md was significantly outdated (showed 11 docs, 183 stories)
- Actual state: 20 docs, 258 stories, 9 user roles
- `/gr-update` command caught this during end-of-session workflow
- Consider running `/gr-update` more frequently during document processing sessions
