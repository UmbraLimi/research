**Purpose:** Compare two technologies for a specific use case.

## Actions

1. Check STRUCTURE.md for next comparison file number
2. Create `comp-NNN-[topic].md` in `/research/`
3. Research both technologies
4. Create comparison table:
   - Feature comparison
   - Cost comparison
   - Learning curve
   - Community size
   - Integration with our stack
   - Pros/cons for this use case
5. Provide recommendation with rationale
6. Update STRUCTURE.md and session file

## Example

```
