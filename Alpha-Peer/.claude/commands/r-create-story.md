# Create User Story

**Purpose:** Create a new user story with proper structure.

## Actions

1. Check STRUCTURE.md for next story number
2. Create `story-NNN-[short-title].md` in `/user-stories/`
3. Structure the story with:
   - Story ID and title
   - User persona
   - User goal (As a... I want... So that...)
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Potential technologies
   - Dependencies on other stories
   - Status: Draft/In Research/Ready
4. Update STRUCTURE.md and session file
5. Ask: "Should I add this to Needs.md now or later?"

## Example

```
/r-create-story user login with email/password
```
