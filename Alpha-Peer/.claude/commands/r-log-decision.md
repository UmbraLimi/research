# Log Decision

**Purpose:** Document a decision with full rationale for future reference.

## Actions

1. Check STRUCTURE.md for next decision number
2. Create `decision-NNN-[topic].md` in `/decisions/`
3. Document:
   - What we decided
   - Options considered
   - Rationale for choice
   - Trade-offs accepted
   - Context and constraints
   - Date and session reference
4. Update STRUCTURE.md and session file
5. Ask: "Should I update Needs.md with this decision?"

## Example

```
/r-log-decision chose-vercel-for-hosting
```
