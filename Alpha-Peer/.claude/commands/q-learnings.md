# Document Session Learnings

Create a session learnings document:

1. **Get current timestamp:**
   - Execute `/q-timestamp` to get current date and time
   - Store the DATE and MONTH values for consistent use

2. **Create the file:**
   - Directory: `docs/sessions/ABC/` (where `ABC` is MONTH from step 1)
   - Filename: `XYZ Learnings.md` (where `XYZ` is FILENAME from step 1)
   - Example: `docs/sessions/2025-11/2025-11-21_12-15-34 Learnings.md`

3. **Document the learnings:**
   - Focus on insights, decisions, best practices, or important discoveries made
   - Present as a clear bulleted or numbered list
   - Include both technical and workflow/process learnings
   - Organize by category if multiple types of learnings (e.g., Technical, Workflow, Documentation, Architecture)

4. **Confirm creation:**
   - Display a brief summary in the chat showing the file path created
