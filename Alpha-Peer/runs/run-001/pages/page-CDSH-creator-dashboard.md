### Dashboard Data Aggregation

```typescript
// GET /api/creators/me/dashboard
{
  earnings: {
    pending_balance: 45000,     // cents (from payment_splits)
    total_earned: 250000,       // lifetime
    this_month: 15000,
    payout_threshold: 5000,     // minimum for payout
    last_payout: { ... }
  },
  pending_counts: {
    st_applications: 3,
    cert_requests: 5
  },
  courses: [
    {
      id, title, thumbnail_url,

      revenue: 125000  // Creator's 15% share
    }
  ],

### Earnings Calculation (15% Royalty)

```typescript
// Payment split logic (per CD-020, CD-033):
// When S-T teaches a session:
//   Platform: 15%
//   Creator: 15%    ← This is what CDSH displays
//   S-T: 70%

// Query for creator earnings:
SELECT SUM(amount_cents) FROM payment_splits
WHERE recipient_id = :creator_id
  AND recipient_type = 'creator'
  AND status IN ('pending', 'paid')
GROUP BY status
```

## Notes

- CD-020: Creator gets 15% royalty (calculated in payment_splits)
- Creators may also be Students/STs (multi-role dashboard)
- Email notifications for pending approvals via Resend
- Payout requires active Stripe Connect (see SETT)
- Analytics could expand significantly (CANA page for detailed analytics)
