## Decision: Feeds Only (Not Chat)

RUN-001 uses Stream.io for **Activity Feeds only**, not for Chat or Video.

### Rationale

| Factor | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| DIR-002 | MUST-USE Stream for activity feeds |
| CD-008 | Brian clarified "feeds only" from Stream |
| Chat | Build custom (simpler, lower cost, more control) |
| Video | VideoProvider interface (BBB/PlugNmeet) |

## Stream Products Assessment

**From tech-002-stream.md:**

| Product | Using? | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Activity Feeds** | ✅ Yes | Community feed, course feeds, instructor feeds |
| **Chat** | ❌ No | Build custom - simpler for 1:1 messaging |
| **Video** | ❌ No | BBB/PlugNmeet handles video |

## Integration Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   React App     │────▶│   Stream SDK    │────▶│   Stream API    │
│   (Astro)       │     │   (Client)      │     │   (Cloud)       │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Our Backend   │───── Sync follows, generate tokens
│   (Workers)     │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Token Flow
1. User authenticates with our backend
2. Backend generates Stream user token (server-side)
3. Client connects to Stream with token
4. Stream SDK handles real-time updates
