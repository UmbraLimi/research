# Payment & Revenue Decisions - RUN-001

**Created:** 2025-12-24
**Related Sources:** CD-020 (Payment & Escrow), CD-033 (S-T Pricing Clarification)

---

## Decision: Stripe Connect

RUN-001 uses **Stripe** for all payment processing with **Connect Express** for payouts.

---

## Pricing Model (from CD-033)

### Unified Pricing
- **Course price = S-T price** (no separate Teacher premium)
- Creator prices course as if they're NOT the primary teacher
- "Too complicated for the creator to charge premium. Too confusing." - Brian

### Revenue Split: 85/15
| Recipient | Share | Example ($450 course) |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Platform (PeerLoop) | 15% | $67.50 |
| Creator/S-T | 85% | $382.50 |

**When Creator teaches:** Creator receives full 85% (they're playing the S-T role)
**When S-T teaches:** Split TBD between Creator royalty and S-T payment

### Any-Time Refunds
- Students can request refund at any time
- "The pressure is on the student teacher to earn his pay" - Brian
- Implications for escrow/hold period

---

## Stripe Products Used

### Stripe Checkout
- **Purpose:** Course enrollment payments
- **Flow:** Redirect to Stripe-hosted checkout page
- **Benefits:** PCI compliance handled, no card data on our servers

```
Student clicks "Enroll"
  → Redirect to Stripe Checkout
    → Payment success
      → Webhook to our backend
        → Create enrollment record
          → Grant course access
```

### Stripe Connect (Express)
- **Purpose:** Pay out creators and S-Ts
- **Account Type:** Express (Stripe-hosted onboarding)
- **Flow:**
  1. Creator/S-T signs up → Create Connect account
  2. Session completes → Calculate split
  3. Admin triggers payout → Transfer to Connect account

### Stripe Webhooks
| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `checkout.session.completed` | Create enrollment, grant access |
| `payment_intent.succeeded` | Confirm payment recorded |
| `payout.paid` | Update payout status |
| `account.updated` | Update Connect account status |
| `charge.refunded` | Process refund, revoke access |

### Payout Flow

```
Session completes
  → S-T recommends completion (or session recorded)
    → Calculate split (15% platform, 85% recipient)
      → Hold in Stripe (escrow period if any)
        → Admin approves OR auto-release
          → Transfer to Connect account
            → Webhook confirms payout
```

## Escrow/Hold Period

### Open Question
CD-020 mentions escrow, but CD-033 says "any-time refunds." Need to reconcile:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **No hold** | Simple, fast payouts | Risk if student refunds after payout |
| **Session hold** | Pay after session completes | S-T waits for payment |
| **7-day hold** | Refund window | Delays earnings |

**RUN-001 Assumption:** Pay after session completes (no additional hold). Refunds clawback from future earnings if needed.

## Connect Onboarding

### Creator/S-T Signup Flow
1. User registers on PeerLoop
2. When ready to earn, clicks "Set up payments"
3. Redirected to Stripe Connect Express onboarding
4. Stripe collects identity, bank info
5. Webhook confirms account ready
6. User can now receive payouts

### Connect Account Types
| Type | Onboarding | Control | Best For |
|------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Express** | Stripe-hosted | Limited | PeerLoop (recommended) |
| Standard | User's Stripe | Full | Not applicable |
| Custom | We build it | Full | Complex needs |

**RUN-001 Decision:** Express accounts - Stripe handles KYC, tax forms, etc.

---

## Stripe Fees

| Transaction | Fee |
|-------------|-----|
| Card payment | 2.9% + $0.30 |
| Connect transfer | Free (within platform) |
| Payout to bank | Free (standard) |
| Refund | Original fee lost |

**Example $450 course:**
- Stripe fee: ~$13.35 (2.9% + $0.30)
- Net to platform: $436.65
- Platform share (15%): $65.50
- Creator/S-T share (85%): $371.15

## Implementation Notes

### Stripe SDK
```javascript
// Server-side (Workers)
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

// Create checkout session
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'payment',
  line_items: [{
    price_data: {
      currency: 'usd',
      product_data: { name: course.title },
      unit_amount: course.price_cents,
    },
    quantity: 1,
  }],
  success_url: `${baseUrl}/courses/${courseId}/success`,
  cancel_url: `${baseUrl}/courses/${courseId}`,
  metadata: {
    course_id: courseId,
    user_id: userId,
  },
});
```

### Webhook Handler
```javascript
// Verify webhook signature
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  body,
  signature,
  process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
);

switch (event.type) {
  case 'checkout.session.completed':
    await handleEnrollment(event.data.object);
    break;
  case 'charge.refunded':
    await handleRefund(event.data.object);
    break;
}
```
