## Naming Conventions

### Numbering
- **NNN format:** Zero-padded 3 digits (001, 002, ..., 999)
- Numbering is sequential within each category
- If we exceed 999, switch to NNNN format

### File naming patterns
- **Client Documents:** `CD-NNN` prefix in `client-docs-index.md`
  - Example: `CD-001: Alpha_Peer_Business_Plan.pdf`
  - Used for cross-referencing in GOALS.md, USER-STORIES.md, etc.
- **Goals:** `GO-NNN` in `GOALS.md`
  - Example: `GO-001: Validate the Learn-Teach-Earn Flywheel`
  - Supports up to 999 goals
- **User Stories (in USER-STORIES.md):** `US-[Role]NNN`
  - Role codes: A=Admin, C=Creator, S=Student, T=Student-Teacher, E=Employer, V=Video/Session, P=Platform
  - Example: `US-A001`, `US-S015`, `US-T003`
  - Supports up to 999 stories per role
- **User Story files:** `story-NNN-[2-4-word-description].md`
  - Example: `story-001-user-login.md`
  - For detailed story breakdowns (optional)
- **Technologies:** `tech-NNN-[technology-name].md`
  - Example: `tech-001-supabase.md`
- **Comparisons:** `comp-NNN-[what-being-compared].md`
  - Example: `comp-001-auth-providers.md`
- **Sessions:** `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS [Type].md` in `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM/`
  - Types: `Learnings`, `Prompts`
  - Example: `docs/sessions/2025-11/2025-11-25_14-30-00 Learnings.md`
- **Learnings:** `learning-NNN-[topic].md`
  - Example: `learning-001-websocket-basics.md`
- **Decisions:** `decision-NNN-[choice-made].md`
  - Example: `decision-001-chose-vercel-hosting.md`
- **Scenarios:** `sc-NNN-[description]-SPECS.md`
  - Example: `sc-001-supabase-stack-SPECS.md`
  - Used for comparing different technology/architecture choices before finalizing SPECS.md
- **Directives:** `DIR-NNN` in `DIRECTIVES.md`
  - Example: `DIR-001: MUST-USE BigBlueButton for video conferencing`
  - Constraints and restrictions consulted during RUN phase scenario generation

### Content guidelines
- Use lowercase for filenames (except STRUCTURE.md, SPECS.md, GOALS.md, USER-STORIES.md, DIRECTIVES.md, PLAN.md)
- Use hyphens for spaces in filenames
- Keep filenames descriptive but concise
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601)

### Document Versioning
Key documents have version numbers for scenario lineage tracking:

| Document | Version Field | Increment When |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| GOALS.md | `**Version:** vN` | New goals, changed metrics, revised mission |
| USER-STORIES.md | `**Version:** vN` | New stories, priority changes, removed stories |
| DIRECTIVES.md | `**Version:** vN` | New directives, changed constraints |
| CLAUDE.md | `**Version:** vN` | New phases, changed workflows, new commands |

**Do NOT increment** for minor edits (typos, formatting, clarifications).

Scenarios record which versions they were built from. A scenario becomes **stale** when any source document version is newer than recorded.

## File Purposes

### STRUCTURE.md (this file)
The single source of truth for organization. Claude Desktop consults this to know:
- Where to put new files
- What naming convention to use
- What each folder contains
- Current state of numbering

### GOALS.md
Mission statement and goals extracted from client documents. Contains:
- Mission statement and core philosophy
- Strategic goals (G1, G2, etc.)
- Quantified success metrics and targets
- Platform capability goals
- Goal-to-source document traceability

Updated automatically via `/r-add-client-doc` when new documents are processed.

### USER-STORIES.md
Comprehensive list of user stories extracted from client documents. Contains:
- Stories organized by user role (Admin, Creator, Student, Student-Teacher, Employer, System)
- Priority levels (P0=MVP critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=nice-to-have)
- Story ID format: `US-[Role][NN]` (e.g., US-A01, US-S15)
- Source document traceability
- Statistics by role and priority

Updated automatically via `/r-add-client-doc` when new documents are processed.

### SPECS.md
The evolving technical specifications document that will be handed to Claude Code. Contains:
- User stories with technology mappings
- Architecture decisions
- Technology stack choices
- Integration requirements
- Non-functional requirements

### DB-SCHEMA.md
Database schema accumulating during GATHER phase. Contains:
- Entity definitions with fields and types
- Relationships between entities
- Source document traceability for each field
- Notes for implementation

Updated via analysis of client documents (e.g., CD-021 database sample). During RUN phase, scenarios may have schema variations.

### PAGES.md
Page inventory accumulating during GATHER phase. Contains:
- All application pages/screens
- Data sources for each page
- User stories satisfied by each page
- Key elements and actions per page

Updated via analysis of client documents and user stories. During RUN phase, scenarios may add/remove pages.

### COMPONENTS.md
Reusable UI component library accumulating during GATHER phase. Contains:
- Component definitions with props
- Pages where each component is used
- Data sources for each component
- Display fields and actions

Updated via analysis of client documents and pages. During RUN phase, scenarios may specify different implementations.

### API.md
Backend API operations surface accumulating during GATHER phase. Contains:
- Endpoint definitions with request/response formats
- User stories satisfied by each endpoint
- Access control requirements
- Webhook integrations

Updated via analysis of user stories and data requirements. During RUN phase, scenarios may specify REST vs GraphQL, etc.

### DIRECTIVES.md
Constraints, restrictions, and preferences that must be consulted during RUN phase:
- **MUST-USE:** Required software/services (client-specified or technically necessary)
- **MUST-AVOID:** Software/approaches to not use
- **NO-COMBINE:** Technologies that don't work well together
- **PREFER:** Favor this option when alternatives exist
- **REQUIRES:** If using X, must also use Y
- **FEATURE-FLAG:** Specific features to enable/disable

Added via `/r-add-directive` command. Grows during GATHER, consumed during RUN.

### Scenarios (/scenarios/)
Alternative SPECS.md variants for client comparison and decision-making:
- Each scenario represents a different technology stack or architectural approach
- Format mirrors SPECS.md but with specific choices filled in
- Client reviews scenarios and picks one to become the final SPECS.md
- Workflow:
  1. Create scenarios based on research findings
  2. Client compares options (e.g., Supabase vs. separate services)
  3. Client selects preferred scenario
  4. Selected scenario becomes SPECS.md at root level

**Required Scenario Header (Source Versions):**
Every scenario file must include this header to track lineage:

```markdown
## Source Versions
| Document | Version | Date |
|----------|---------|------|
| GOALS.md | v1 | 2025-11-30 |
| USER-STORIES.md | v1 | 2025-11-30 |
| DIRECTIVES.md | v1 | 2025-11-30 |
| CLAUDE.md | v1 | 2025-11-30 |

**Lineage Status:** ✅ Current
```

**Lineage Status values:**
- ✅ **Current** - All source versions match or scenario is newer
- ⚠️ **Stale** - One or more source documents updated since scenario created
- 🔄 **Updating** - Scenario is being revised to match new sources

### Client documents (/client-docs/)
Original materials provided by the Alpha Peer client:
- Requirements documents and briefs
- Meeting notes from client discussions
- Design mockups, wireframes, brand guidelines
- Business context and market analysis
- Keep originals unchanged; reference in research and decisions
- Source of truth for client requirements and constraints

### Session files (`docs/sessions/`)
Session logs are organized by month in `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM/`. Two file types per session:
- **Learnings.md** - Insights, decisions, best practices discovered
- **Prompts.md** - Archive of user prompts for future reference

Created via `/q-end-session` or individual `/q-learnings`, `/q-prompts` commands.

### Prompt library
Reusable prompts for common tasks:
- Research a technology
- Create a user story
- Compare options
- Update SPECS.md
- Create session summary

### Learnings index
Quick reference showing:
- What we've learned (with links to detailed files)
- Key insights
- Gotchas discovered
- Patterns emerging

### Runs (/runs/)
RUN phase execution tracking with full traceability:
- **RUN-INDEX.md** - Quick reference to all runs with status
- **run-NNN/** - One folder per run containing:
  - `run-NNN.md` - Run specification (inputs, parameters, decisions, rationale)
  - `scenario.md` - Generated SPECS.md for this run
  - `review-notes.md` - Client feedback and discussion
  - `assets/` - Supporting files (comparisons, diagrams, etc.)
- **approved/** - Final approved scenario for handoff

**Run Workflow:**
1. Create new run folder with `run-NNN.md` specifying inputs
2. **Consult research files** in `/research/tech-*.md` for technologies in scope
3. Generate `scenario.md` based on inputs + GATHER materials + research
4. **Create run-specific assets** in `assets/` documenting how research applies to this run
5. Review with client, document feedback in `review-notes.md`
6. Record decisions and rationale in run file
7. Update status in RUN-INDEX.md
8. If approved: copy scenario to `/approved/SPECS.md` then to root `SPECS.md`

**Research & Assets:**
- **Global research** (`research/tech-*.md`) - Broadly useful info about technologies (features, pricing, limitations)
- **Run-specific assets** (`run-NNN/assets/`) - How that knowledge applies to THIS run's constraints
- New learnings during a run should update global research files
- Run-specific decisions go in assets folder

**Run Naming:** `run-NNN` where NNN is zero-padded (run-001, run-002, etc.)

## Workflow Principles

1. **Opportunistic:** Follow interesting leads as they emerge
2. **Documented:** Every session and decision gets recorded
3. **Iterative:** SPECS.md evolves continuously, not written once
4. **Traceable:** Can always trace why decisions were made
5. **Handoff-ready:** Structure supports giving everything to Claude Code
