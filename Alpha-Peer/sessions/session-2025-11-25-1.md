# Session 2025-11-25-1

**Date:** November 25, 2025  
**Session:** 1 (first session of the day)  
**Duration:** In progress

## Goals
- Set up MCP filesystem access in Claude Desktop
- Establish folder structure for Alpha Peer project
- Create documentation and workflow templates
- Understand project organization approach

## Starting Point
- New project, no prior structure
- Need to establish systematic approach for research and planning
- Goal: Create structure that supports iterative, opportunistic development

## Work Completed

### MCP Setup
- Troubleshot MCP configuration (config file was in wrong location)
- Successfully configured filesystem access to ~/MyResearch
- Verified MCP working with test commands

### Project Structure
- Created Alpha-Peer folder structure:
  - /client-docs (client-provided materials)
  - /research (technology research)
  - /user-stories (user stories & requirements)
  - /sessions (session tracking)
  - /prompts (reusable prompts)
  - /learnings (knowledge capture)
  - /decisions (decision log)

### Documentation Created
- STRUCTURE.md - Master organization guide (updated with /client-docs/)
- prompt-library.md - Reusable prompt templates (updated with command references)
- learnings-index.md - Learning tracking system
- Needs.md - Evolving requirements document
- session-2025-11-25-1.md - This file
- setup-conversation-summary.md - Summary of initial setup
- **commands.md** - Claude Code-style command system
- **session-start-template.md** - Template for beginning sessions
- **client-docs/README.md** - Guide for client materials

## Prompts Used
- "Create a subfolder called 'Alpha-Peer'"
- "Create a readme.md file"
- Various structure and template creation requests

## Decisions Made
- Use numbered naming convention (NNN format)
- Separate files for prompts, learnings, and decisions
- Keep structure flexible for opportunistic exploration
- **REVERSED:** Initially planned to use Projects, but decided on session-start prompts instead
- Created command system to emulate Claude Code slash commands
- Use session-start template for each work session

## Learnings
- MCP config must be in ~/Library/Application Support/Claude (user level), not /Library
- Projects have "soft boundaries" - can't enforce folder restrictions
- Project Knowledge files are loaded at conversation start, can become stale within a session
- Session-start prompts provide better control and CC-like workflow
- Command system (convention-based) can emulate CC slash commands in CD
- Explicit context loading (session prompts) > implicit (Projects) for iterative work

## Next Steps
- Test the command system in next session
- Begin actual Alpha Peer research
- Create first user story
- Start technology evaluation
- Use session-start template to begin next session

## Notes
- Structure is designed to evolve as patterns emerge
- Focus is on capturing decisions and learnings, not comprehensive evaluation
- All work traceable for eventual handoff to Claude Code
