## Notes for Implementation

1. **UUIDs vs Integer IDs:** UUIDs recommended for distributed systems and security
2. **Timestamps:** Use UTC, handle timezone display in application layer
3. **Soft Deletes:** Consider `deleted_at` columns for audit trail
4. **Computed Fields:** user_stats may be better as computed view
5. **getstream.io:** Posts/feed may be managed externally; local tables for reference data
6. **Stripe:** transactions link to Stripe via payment_id for reconciliation
