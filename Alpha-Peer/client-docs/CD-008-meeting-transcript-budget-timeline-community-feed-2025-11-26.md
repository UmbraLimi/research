## Summary of Brian's Stated Wants

*This document summarizes only Brian LeBlanc's (client) stated positions from the meeting. Questions and suggestions from Gabriel and Fraser are excluded.*

---

## Budget & Timeline

- **Budget: $75,000** (increased from Gabriel's more conservative estimate)
- **Timeline: 4 months**
- Rationale: "I want to take a bigger risk, and I've been working on this six or eight months with this goal in mind"

## Community Feed - Critical Priority

### Why Build It Now (Not Later)
> "If we give that up, and then we validate this, we'll be scrambling like crazy to try to get it after the fact. I feel like it would be a nut house after the fact, and so I want to build it ahead of time."

### Fallback Value
> "Whatever we build will have some value, even if the core thesis doesn't work. I'll have a tutoring site with some unique functionality and a community feed, and I can do something with it, so it's not going to be wasted, and I can continue to try different routes."

## Community Feed Purpose - Marketing Funnel

Brian's vision for how the feed works as a conversion funnel:

1. **Discovery**: Student comes to site, sees courses, clicks "follow" to explore (not buy yet)
2. **Following**: They see a creator, click "follow"
3. **Feed Content**: Feeds from that subject/course appear in their community feed
4. **Social Proof**: They see discussions like "I took this course, I built this app, got 8 weeks work done in a week, let me teach you how to do it"
5. **Public Forum**: People discuss pros/cons publicly
6. **Conversion**: "You can talk somebody into the course, come in as a student-teacher, bring them in"
7. **Retention**: After completing course, they stay in community looking for people to connect with and teach

> "That's a marketing funnel. It just overcomes all the resistance."

### Current Problem with Self-Paced Sites
> "If you just go to a course listing now you see it, you're on your own. You really can't interact with these self-paced sites much, and so you're exploring a course on your own. You're taking the course on your own. You're in isolation. I'm trying to bring in the community feed."

## Core Philosophy - Human Connection

> "People motivate people. Computers don't motivate people. That dulls them and sucks them out."

> "I'm not just interested in teaching people cold, hard facts. I want to connect people. And it's not just during a live session."

> "The human connections are overlooked in this quest to educate people. I've been watching it for 25 years, and I feel like everybody assumes people can be motivated, and that's the missing link."

> "Just the one hour paid session is not enough of a connection, in my opinion, to keep people interested and motivated. So I think it's vital to have the community."

### 25 Years of Observation
> "In 1998 I think when the internet was starting, I put some courses online, and I got everybody in town to sign up, and I was disappointed they didn't use it. And I watched it for 25 years, and I think everybody's making the same mistake. It's like we can replace humans with computers. And at every step of the process they go into this, the computers can do it. I think there's a psychology in this whole process of learning that everybody overlooks."

## Stream (GetStream.io) Usage - Clarified

- **Only wants the feeds feature** from Stream
- Does NOT want their video conferencing
- Chat is lower priority

> "They're all individual offerings. From what I understand, you can build video conferencing if you want to use that tool, but you don't have to. You can just use the feeds, and that's all I want to use from their services. Maybe chatting, but that's much lower on the priority list, but the community feeds is all I want out of there."

---

## Skool.com as Prototype

Brian agreed to use Skool as the reference implementation:

> "Let's use Skool as the prototype to build our community feed."

Skool was cited as "a good example of how it would work" with "a community that's thriving."

---

## Video Conferencing

- Mentioned **Jitsi** as a possibility (from Q/Claude feedback)
- Noted concerns: "It doesn't seem like it's quite as full featured"
