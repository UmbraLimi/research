**Date:** 2025-11-29  
**Decider:** Brian  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED  
**Implementation:** Immediate

---

## Decision Summary

**Product name change:** AlphaPeer → **PeerLoop**  
**Domain change:** alphapeer.com → **peerloop.com**  
**Subdomain:** class.alphapeer.com → **class.peerloop.com**

---

## Reasoning

### Trademark Conflict

**Issue:** Alpha.school is actively trademarking "Alpha" names related to education/school businesses.

**Risk:** Continuing with "AlphaPeer" creates:
- Potential trademark infringement
- Legal challenges before/during launch
- Rebranding costs if forced to change later
- Brand confusion with Alpha.school

**Decision:** Proactively rebrand to avoid legal issues.

## Why PeerLoop?

**Brand Identity:**
- Maintains peer-to-peer learning focus (Peer)
- Loop suggests continuous learning cycle, flywheel effect
- Clean, memorable, one-word brand
- Available domain: peerloop.com

**No Trademark Conflicts:**
- No existing trademark on "PeerLoop" in education space
- Unique brand identity
- Can proceed with confidence
