# Instructor: Guy Rymberg or Gabriel Rymberg

## Profile

**Name:** Guy Rymberg or Gabriel Rymberg (TBD)
**Role:** AI & Automation Expert, Entrepreneur
**Specialization:** Vibe Coding, AI-Powered Development, Strategic Architecture

## Bio

Your instructor is an experienced vibe coder who builds real production applications using AI assistance daily. As early adopters of Claude Code and creators of the q-vibe-coder framework, they bring hands-on expertise in the structured methodologies that make vibe coding reliable and repeatable.

With a background in both entrepreneurship and AI-assisted development, they understand what it takes to go from idea to deployed application. They've used the 6-phase methodology taught in this course to build everything from simple landing pages to complex web applications - all while maintaining clean, maintainable code and professional development practices.

Their passion is empowering non-technical builders to create real software. After experiencing firsthand how structured vibe coding transformed their own workflow, they became dedicated to teaching others the same systematic approach. They believe that with the right methodology and tools, anyone can build and deploy professional web applications - no computer science degree required.

## Teaching Philosophy

"Vibe coding works when you have structure. I teach the 6-phase methodology that professionals use - Vision, Constraints, Architecture, Building, Testing, Deployment. This isn't about randomly prompting AI and hoping for the best. It's about making strategic decisions upfront, understanding tool limitations, and directing AI through a proven process. You'll learn to think architecturally, troubleshoot effectively, and ship real projects to production."
