# Vibe Coding 101 - Course Overview

## Course Description

Learn to build and deploy real websites using AI as your development partner. This hands-on course takes you from project idea to production deployment, teaching you the structured methodology that turns vibe coding into a reliable, repeatable skill.

Vibe coding isn't about letting AI do everything blindly - it's about directing AI strategically through a proven process. You'll learn the 6-phase methodology used by experienced AI-assisted developers: Vision, Constraints, Architecture, Building, Testing, and Deployment. By the end, you'll have deployed your own website to the internet and gained the skills to build more.

Perfect for graduates of "Intro to Claude Code" who are ready to build real projects, or anyone with Claude Code knowledge who wants structured workflows for turning ideas into production applications. You'll work with industry-standard tools (GitHub, Vercel) and learn professional practices that scale beyond simple demos.

## What You'll Learn

### Session 1: Planning & Setup
- **Vibe Coding Mindset** - How to work with AI as a coding partner, the taste principle, and when to use AI vs manual coding
- **The 6-Phase Methodology** - Vision, Constraints, Architecture, Building, Testing, Deployment - the structured process for any project
- **Strategic Planning** - How to make upfront technical decisions (deployment, stack, architecture) that affect your entire build
- **Tool Limitations** - Understanding what's possible vs not possible with AI, and when to involve other tools or integrations
- **Q-System Session Management** - Using `/q-begin`, `/q-end`, `/q-checkpoint` for managing long projects across multiple sessions
- **q-vibe-coder Template** - Setting up the structured framework for your project (profile, project definition, session logs)
- **GitHub Repository Setup** - Creating repos, managing code, understanding git workflows for AI-assisted development
- **Vercel Configuration** - Setting up deployment infrastructure before you build (architecture follows deployment)

### Session 2: Building & Deployment
- **Iterative Building** - Building component by component with Claude, using the q-vibe-coder methodology files
- **Troubleshooting & Debugging** - Common errors, how to fix them, debugging strategies, git recovery techniques
- **Problem-Solving Strategies** - Working through blockers, when to pivot, when to simplify, how to stay unblocked
- **Project Refinement** - Iterative improvements, testing, validation, polish
- **Production Deployment** - Deploying your website to Vercel, connecting domains, going live
- **Final Project Review** - Reviewing what you built, what you learned, next steps for maintenance and iteration

## Why Vibe Coding 101?

**Structured Process** - Learn the proven 6-phase methodology that experienced vibe coders use, not random trial and error.

**Real Deployment** - Don't just build locally - deploy to production on Vercel and GitHub, using the same tools professionals use.

**Strategic Thinking** - Learn to make architectural decisions upfront (like where to deploy) that prevent painful refactors later.

**Professional Tools** - Work with GitHub for version control and Vercel for deployment - skills that transfer to any web project.

**Session Management** - Master the Q-System for managing long projects across multiple sessions without losing context.

## Who This Course Is For

✓ **Intro to Claude Code graduates** who are ready to build complete projects from start to finish

✓ **Non-technical entrepreneurs** who need landing pages, portfolio sites, or simple web applications

✓ **AI-curious builders** who want structured workflows instead of chaotic vibe coding

✓ **Anyone with Claude Code knowledge** who wants to learn professional deployment and git workflows

✓ **Students wanting to become teachers** - this course prepares you to teach others vibe coding

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have:
- A fully functional website or landing page deployed to production
- Your own GitHub repository with clean, organized code
- Live URL on Vercel that you can share with anyone
- q-vibe-coder project structure for future builds

**Project Scope:**
- Simple, focused web project (no complex APIs)
- Professional-looking design
- Hosted on GitHub (version control)
- Deployed on Vercel (production hosting)
- Built using the 6-phase vibe coding methodology

## Course Format

- **2 live 1-on-1 sessions** (90 minutes each)
- **Hands-on building** during each session
- **Homework project** between sessions (optional)
- **Lifetime access** to course materials and q-vibe-coder template
- **Certificate of completion**
- **Small student-teacher ratio** for personalized attention

## After This Course

Upon completion, you'll be ready to:
- Build and deploy your own web projects independently
- Use the 6-phase methodology for any software project
- Manage complex projects with Q-System session management
- Continue learning advanced topics (APIs, databases, complex integrations)
- Apply to become a PeerLoop student-teacher and earn by teaching others
- Join the PeerLoop community of AI-powered builders
