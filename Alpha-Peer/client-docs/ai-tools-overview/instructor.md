## Profile

**Name:** Guy Rymberg
**Role:** AI & Automation Expert, Entrepreneur
**Specialization:** AI Tools Evaluation, Strategic AI Adoption, Workflow Integration

## Bio

Guy Rymberg is an AI enthusiast and entrepreneur who has extensively explored and tested the rapidly evolving landscape of AI tools. As someone who lived through the AI explosion of 2023-2025, Guy understands firsthand what it's like to be overwhelmed by constant tool announcements, competing claims, and fear of missing out on the "next big thing."

Rather than trying every new AI tool that launches, Guy developed a strategic framework for evaluating and choosing AI tools based on actual needs and use cases. His approach focuses on reducing overwhelm, avoiding shiny object syndrome, and building a practical toolkit that solves real problems. He uses AI tools daily across writing, coding, automation, and creative work - not because they're trendy, but because they genuinely improve his productivity and capabilities.

Guy's passion is helping people cut through AI hype and make smart, strategic choices about which tools to adopt. He believes the goal isn't to use every AI tool that exists - it's to use the right tools for your specific needs and to have a framework for confidently evaluating new tools as they emerge.

## Teaching Philosophy

"The AI landscape is overwhelming by design - every company wants you to think their tool is essential. My job is to help you see through the noise. I teach you to think strategically about AI tools, not to memorize a list that'll be outdated in three months. You'll learn a decision-making framework that works whether you're choosing between ChatGPT and Claude today, or evaluating whatever new AI tool launches tomorrow. The goal is confidence, not FOMO."
