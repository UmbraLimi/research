# Slack Conversation: S-T Pricing Clarification

**Source:** Slack conversation between Fraser Gorrie and Brian LeBlanc
**Date:** 2025-12-24
**Type:** Clarification / Decision

---

## Context

Fraser raised Question #23 from QUESTIONS-FOR-BRIAN.md regarding how prospective students discover Student-Teacher pricing before purchasing a course.

---

## Key Decisions

### 1. Unified Pricing Model (CONFIRMED)

**The course price IS the S-T price.** There is no separate pricing for Teachers vs Student-Teachers.

> "The creator has to price it as if he is not the primary teacher. His time is worth more but he needs the course to be a reasonable price for a less qualified student teacher. Too complicated for the creator to charge premium. Too confusing."

**Implication:** Question #23 is resolved - there's no "hidden S-T pricing" because the displayed course price already reflects S-T-level pricing.

### 2. Enrollment Flow (CLARIFIED)

1. Student finds a course, clicks to get detail
2. Clicks **Enroll** button
3. Sees a **calendar with dots** on dates where student teachers are available
4. **List of student teachers with times** displayed below calendar
5. Click on student teacher for more detail OR click time and purchase
6. **"Schedule Later" button** should also be available
7. After purchase: access to course feed, can find S-T in the feed

> "They can purchase the course, get access to the course feed and find a student teacher in the feed. But they can schedule at time of payment or after."

### 3. Creator Teaching Role (CLARIFIED)

- Creator **can teach** but will likely reduce as network grows
- Creator charges **same fee as S-Ts** (no premium pricing)
- Creator's role is to "prime the pump" - teach initially and certify S-Ts
- Community takes over teaching over time

> "The creator has to understand his time will be spent priming the pump. But his community will take over."

### 4. Revenue Split (CONFIRMED)

**85/15 split**

Example given: If course lists for $450:
- Site gets $67.50 (15%)
- Creator gets $67.50 (15%)
- Balance ($315, 70%) is "up for adjustments" (goes to S-T when S-T teaches)

When creator teaches: creator earns it all (minus platform fee).

### 5. Refund Policy (NEW)

> "The student can bail at any time and get a refund. The pressure is on the student teacher to earn his pay."

### 6. S-T Discount Option (POSTPONED)

Brian initially mentioned S-Ts could teach at a discount or free to gain experience and ratings. After discussion:

> "Not sure we should let student teachers get in a bidding war. That might cheapen the experience... maybe we postpone that for now. Let's see if quality student teacher experience holds up."

**Decision:** Defer variable S-T pricing. All S-Ts charge the course rate for MVP.

## Full Conversation Transcript

**Fraser Gorrie** 1:28 PM
> Hi @Brian LeBlanc, I have a question about the student enrollment flow.
>
> When a prospective student visits a course page, they see the Teacher's course price. But Student-Teachers in that course can also teach at (likely cheaper) rates.
>
> The gap I'm seeing: How does a new student know S-Ts are available and what they charge *before* buying the course? Right now it seems like they'd only discover S-T options after they're already enrolled.
>
> I might be misunderstanding how this works. Maybe the course price is just for content access and sessions are always booked separately? Or maybe S-T discovery is intentionally post-enrollment?
>
> Some options if this is a real gap:
> 1. Show S-T price range on course page ("Sessions from $30-75/hr with certified student-teachers")
> 2. Add a "Find a Tutor" section on course pages showing available S-Ts
> 3. Create an S-T directory browsable without course purchase
> 4. Keep it as-is if post-enrollment discovery is intentional
>
> Let me know if I'm overthinking this or if we should add it to the list for MVP consideration.

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:00 PM
> Subject to change. A student finds a course, clicks to get detail. Clicks enroll button. See's a calendar with dots on dates where student teachers are available. A list of student teachers with times displayed below calendar. Click on student teacher for more detail or click time and purchase. I have a rough version of this now if you want to enroll in a course. I didn't put this, but I think a schedule later button should be available. They can purchase the course, get access to the course feed and find a student teacher in the feed.
>
> I do think student teachers should have an option to teach at a discount or even free to gain experience and ratings. But we have to determine a minimum and charge for the site and the creator.
>
> If the course lists for $450, the site gets $67.5, the creator gets $67.5, and the balance is up for adjustments.

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:05 PM
> Does a course creator still teach? And can a student pick them? SO enrolling in a course occurs without paying/selecting who will do the teaching?

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:09 PM
> The creator can teach all he wants. he probably won't much as the network grows. He has to charge the same fee as the student teachers to keep it simple. His time is more valuable but he has to prime the pump. He has to teach someone or pre certify student teachers who already know the course. Students can pick him if he offers time on his calendar. You have to enroll and pay to get access to the course feed. But they can schedule at time of payment or after.

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:10 PM
> What does enrolment entail? It seems different from paying for a course.

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:10 PM
> enroll means pay something. not sure what you are asking

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:12 PM
> If enrolling is paying, then selecting a student teacher would mean they all charge the same amount. I get that. You mentioned discounts though for some S-T's. So I am not sure how that would work if they already paid the full price.

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:13 PM
> true. hmm

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:13 PM
> This is the only blocker I have at the moment

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:14 PM
> not sure we should let student teachers get in a bidding war. That might cheapen the experience. hmm what do you think

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:14 PM
> true. But the expectation might be that they should be cheaper

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:14 PM
> yea a green student teacher might need that option. maybe we postpone that for now. lets see if quality student teacher experience holds up

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:15 PM
> DO you mind if I plan for the ability for the user to see S-T prices for a course as well as the teachers?

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:16 PM
> the creator has to price it as if he is not the primary teacher. his time is worth more but he needs the course to be a reasonable price for a less qualified student teacher. Too complicated for the creator to charge premium. too confusing.

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:16 PM
> AH. SO the pricing already IS S-T pricing!. ok then

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:17 PM
> the creator has to understand his time will be spend priming the pump. but his community will take over

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:17 PM
> Gotcha

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:18 PM
> also the student can bail at anytime and get a refund. The pressure is on the student teacher to earn his pay.

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:18 PM
> Good stuff. Thanks for the clarification. Does "priming the pump" mean that course creators don't charge for there direct sessions with would-be S-Ts?

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:20 PM
> no they would charge exactly what a student teacher would charge. I think we have to keep it simple

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:20 PM
> In that case, what is the split? 85/15 70/30?

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:21 PM
> oh yea your right. as far as the student signing up he is paying one fee. but yes the creator earns it all. yes. 85/15

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:21 PM
> yes

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:21 PM
> yes

**Fraser Gorrie** 2:22 PM
> Thanks, Brian. I won't take you away from family any more. Merry Christmas

**Brian LeBlanc** 2:23 PM
> Merry Christmas. We did christmas already. Packing up to drive home tomorrow. I have all day :)
