# Intro to Claude Code - Course Overview

## Course Description

Learn to harness the power of AI-assisted development with Claude Code - Anthropic's revolutionary terminal-based coding assistant. This hands-on course transforms complete beginners into confident AI-powered builders, without requiring any prior coding experience.

Claude Code isn't just another coding tool - it's your AI partner that works directly in your terminal, understanding your projects deeply and helping you build real applications through natural conversation. Unlike traditional learning paths that take months, you'll be building functional projects in hours.

Perfect for professionals who want to automate tasks, entrepreneurs who want to prototype ideas, and anyone curious about the future of human-AI collaboration. You'll learn through practical exercises, building real projects while understanding exactly how to guide AI to produce clean, maintainable code.

## What You'll Learn

### Session 1: Foundation & Core Concepts
- **Installation & Setup** - Get Claude Code running on Windows or Mac, authenticate your account, and configure your development environment
- **Project Context with CLAUDE.md** - Initialize intelligent project memory so Claude understands your codebase structure, conventions, and preferences
- **Context Management** - Add files, images, and references to give Claude the right information at the right time
- **Managing Context Efficiently** - Keep your sessions focused using clear, compact, and resume commands to avoid information overload
- **Tools & Permissions** - Understand Claude's built-in capabilities (read, edit, bash) and control what it can access
- **Permission Configuration** - Set up project-wide permissions to streamline your workflow

### Session 2: Advanced Techniques & Workflows
- **Planning Mode** - Handle complex, multi-file tasks by letting Claude create structured plans before executing
- **Thinking Modes** - Activate different levels of reasoning (think, think hard, ultra think) for challenging logic problems
- **Built-in Commands** - Master essential slash commands for memory, context, and session management
- **Custom Commands** - Create reusable command templates for your common tasks and workflows
- **Real-World Project Workflow** - Put everything together to build a complete project from scratch
- **Best Practices** - Learn when to use AI, when to code manually, and how to stay in control

## Why Claude Code?

**Terminal-First Design** - Works with any code editor, integrates seamlessly into your existing workflow without forcing you to switch tools.

**Deep Codebase Understanding** - Claude doesn't just generate isolated snippets - it analyzes your entire project structure to produce contextually appropriate code.

**Transparent & Controllable** - Every action requires your approval. You're always in control, reviewing changes before they happen.

**No Coding Background Needed** - Designed for natural language interaction. If you can describe what you want, Claude can help you build it.
