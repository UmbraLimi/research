## Bio

Guy Rymberg is an entrepreneur and co-founder with a rich background in AI and automation. As an early adopter and heavy daily user of Claude Code, Guy uses it for all his development tasks - including teaching this very course. His hands-on experience spans from building production applications to creating custom automation workflows that transform how non-technical people work with technology.

Guy's passion lies at the intersection of personal transformation and empowering others. After experiencing firsthand how AI coding tools revolutionized his own workflow, he became dedicated to helping non-coders and aspiring developers unlock the same capabilities. He believes that AI assistants like Claude Code democratize software development, making it accessible to anyone with ideas and determination - no computer science degree required.

## Teaching Philosophy

"I don't believe in vibe coding where you just let AI do everything. That leads to bugs and technical debt. Instead, I teach you to code *alongside* Claude - staying in control, understanding what's happening, and building clean, maintainable projects. You'll learn when to use AI, when to step in manually, and how to guide AI to produce exactly what you need."
