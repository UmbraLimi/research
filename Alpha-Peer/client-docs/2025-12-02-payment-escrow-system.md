## Decision Framework Analysis

### 1. Hypothesis Validation ✅

| Hypothesis | Impact | Explanation |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **H1: Market Positioning** | ✅ **STRONG** | Directly tests if students will pay $400-600 |
| **H2: Completion Rates** | ⚠️ Indirect | Escrow milestones may incentivize completion |
| **H3: Customer Segmentation** | ⚠️ Indirect | Payment data identifies customer types |
| **H4: Conversion to Teaching** | ✅ Moderate | 70% payout incentivizes becoming S-T |
| **H5: Peer Teaching Quality** | ❌ None | Doesn't measure teaching quality |
| **H6: Flywheel Validation** | ✅ Moderate | Revenue share enables sustainable flywheel |

**Primary Hypothesis:** H1 (Market Positioning)  
**Brian's Uncertainty Ranking:** #3 - "Will students pay $400-600?"  
**Validation Type:** DIRECT - Only way to test pricing hypothesis

### 2. Genesis Cohort Critical Check ✅

**Is this critical for 60-80 Genesis students?**

- ✅ Critical for enrollment - Must accept payments
- ✅ Critical for payment - Core infrastructure
- ✅ Required to test model - Can't validate H1 without it
- ✅ Students lose trust without it - Must be professional

**Assessment:** ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - Cannot operate platform without payment processing

### 3. Manual Alternative Check ❌

**Can Brian handle payments manually?**

| Task | Manual Feasibility |
|------|-------------------|
| Collect payments | ❌ Venmo/PayPal = unprofessional |
| Calculate splits | ⚠️ Spreadsheet = error-prone |
| Track who paid | ⚠️ Time-consuming |
| Process payouts | ⚠️ 10-15 hrs/month |

**Polished Concierge Test:** ❌ FAILS
- Payment collection MUST be automated (Stripe)
- Split calculation MUST be automated
- Payout execution CAN be semi-manual (Brian clicks button)

**Conclusion:** No viable manual alternative for payment collection

### 4. Budget Impact ✅

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Development Cost** | $11,000 - $15,000 |
| **% of $75K Budget** | 15-20% |
| **Monthly Operating** | ~$50 (Stripe fees separate) |
| **Stripe Fees** | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction |
| **Fits Phase 1?** | ✅ YES |

**Alternative Costs:**
- Fully Manual: $0 dev, but 10-15 hrs/month Brian time
- Fully Automated (Stripe Connect): $16K-$26K

**Chosen:** Semi-Automated saves $5K-$11K vs fully automated

### 5. Timeline Impact ✅

| Metric | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| **Development Time** | 2-3 weeks |
| **Fraser Confidence** | Medium (needs review) |
| **Dependencies** | Creator Profiles ✅, Student Profiles ✅ |
| **Risk Level** | Medium (Stripe well-documented) |

## Why Stripe?

### Chosen Over Alternatives:

| Processor | Verdict | Reason |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Stripe** | ✅ CHOSEN | Best developer experience, industry standard, upgrade path to Connect |
| PayPal | ❌ Rejected | Higher fees, clunky UX, account freeze risk |
| Square | ❌ Rejected | Not optimized for online platforms |
| Paddle | ❌ Rejected | Higher fees, less control |

### Stripe Benefits:
- Industry standard for SaaS/EdTech
- Excellent React components
- Best-in-class documentation
- 99.99% uptime
- Built-in fraud detection
- PCI compliance handled
- Easy upgrade to Stripe Connect in Phase 2
- Dashboard for Brian to monitor transactions

### Stripe Costs:
- 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Example: $500 course = ~$14.80 fee
- 60-80 students × $500 = ~$1,000-1,200 total fees

## Why Semi-Automated?

### Options Evaluated:

| Option | Dev Cost | Brian's Monthly Work | Verdict |
|--------|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **A: Fully Manual** | $0 | 10-15 hours | ❌ Not scalable |
| **B: Semi-Automated** | $11K-$15K | 1-2 hours | ✅ CHOSEN |
| **C: Fully Automated** | $16K-$26K | 0 hours | ❌ Overkill for MVP |

### Semi-Automated Workflow:
1. Student pays via Stripe Checkout
2. System instantly enrolls student
3. System calculates 70/15/15 split
4. System tracks amounts owed to each recipient
5. Monthly: Brian opens Admin Dashboard
6. Brian clicks "Process Payout" for each recipient
7. System sends payment via API
8. Recipients receive funds + confirmation

### Why Not Fully Automated?
- Saves $5K-$11K in development
- For 4-5 creators, clicking buttons is acceptable
- Brian maintains oversight of cash flow
- Can upgrade to Stripe Connect in Phase 2 if needed
- 1-2 hours/month is manageable for MVP
