## Profile

**Name:** Guy Rymberg
**Role:** AI & Automation Expert, Entrepreneur
**Specialization:** Workflow Automation, n8n, Business Process Optimization

## Bio

Guy Rymberg is an entrepreneur and automation expert who has built hundreds of workflows using n8n to streamline business operations and personal productivity. As someone who values efficiency and smart systems, Guy uses n8n daily to connect apps, automate repetitive tasks, and build integrations that would otherwise require hiring developers.

Guy's journey with n8n began from necessity - needing to connect multiple business tools without the budget or complexity of custom development. Through hands-on experience, he discovered that workflow automation isn't just for engineers - it's a learnable skill that empowers anyone to build powerful systems. His workflows range from simple two-node automations to complex multi-step processes handling everything from customer onboarding to data synchronization.

Guy's passion is teaching non-technical people to automate their work and reclaim their time. He believes that automation should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind paywalls or complexity. Through clear explanations and practical examples, he helps students go from automation beginners to confident workflow builders.

## Teaching Philosophy

"Automation is about buying back your time. I don't teach theory - I teach you to build workflows that solve real problems from day one. We'll start simple and build complexity as you gain confidence. By the end, you'll have working automations you actually use, not just demo projects. The goal is to make you independent - able to look at any repetitive task and think 'I can automate that.'"
