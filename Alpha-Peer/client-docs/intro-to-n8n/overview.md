# Intro to n8n - Course Overview

## Course Description

Learn to automate your workflows and connect your favorite apps without writing a single line of code. This hands-on course teaches you n8n - a powerful, visual workflow automation platform that helps you build automations like a developer, without being one.

Stop doing repetitive tasks manually. Whether it's moving data between apps, sending notifications, organizing information, or managing responses, n8n lets you automate it all through a simple drag-and-drop interface. By the end of this course, you'll have built real automations that save you hours every week.

Perfect for non-technical professionals, business owners, and anyone tired of copying data between apps or doing the same tasks over and over. You'll learn by building practical workflows that solve real problems - from simple two-step automations to sophisticated multi-app workflows with conditional logic.
