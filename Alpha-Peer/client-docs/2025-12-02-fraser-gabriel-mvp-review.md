| **Phase 1 Budget** | $75,000 |
| **Allocated** | $46K-62K (61-83%) |
| **Remaining** | $13K-29K |
| **Status** | ⚠️ Getting tight |

### Timeline Status

| Milestone | Date | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|

---

## Context: What We're Building

### The PeerLoop Model

- **Learn, Teach, Earn** flywheel
- Student completes course → Becomes Student-Teacher → Teaches others → Earns 70%
- Revenue split: 70% Student-Teacher / 15% Creator / 15% Platform
- Genesis cohort: 60-80 students across 4-5 courses

### Key Operational Insight (from Dec 2 session)

**Creators control their courses:**
- Creator approves certifications
- Creator approves payouts
- Creator approves new Student-Teachers

**Brian (Platform) = Strategic oversight only:**
- ~3-4 hours/week for 60-80 students
- Creator onboarding
- Exception handling
- Platform monitoring

## Agenda

### 1. Feature-by-Feature Review (30 min)

Walk through each MUST HAVE feature, confirm:
- ✅ Scope understood correctly
- ✅ Estimate is realistic
- ✅ Dependencies identified
- ✅ Any blockers?

**Features to review:**

#### 1.1 Video Conferencing (BigBlueButton)
- **Decision:** Use hosted BBB provider
- **Cost:** $200-300/month
- **Question for Fraser:** Integration complexity? Estimated dev time for BBB room creation + link delivery?

#### 1.2 Community Feed (getstream.io)
- **Decision:** Use GetStream.io for activity feeds
- **Cost:** $99-299/month (Activity Feeds tier)
- **Question for Fraser:** SDK integration experience? Timeline estimate?

#### 1.3 Calendar/Scheduling
- **Options for Fraser:** Cal.com (B), Custom react-big-calendar (D), or Google Calendar API (E)
- **Question for Fraser:** Which do you recommend? Why?
- **Requirements:** ~60 sessions/week, Student-Teacher availability, auto-notifications

#### 1.4 Student Profile System
- **Scope:** Profile pages, follow/followers, Student-Teacher toggle, discovery
- **Estimate:** $14K-18.7K, 3-4 weeks
- **Question for Fraser:** Is this estimate accurate? Can we phase it?

#### 1.5 Creator Profiles
- **Scope:** Basic info page for 4-5 creators
- **Estimate:** $500, <1 week
- **Question for Fraser:** Can this be simplified further?

#### 1.6 Payment & Escrow
- **Approach:** Semi-automated (Stripe + Brian clicks to process payouts)
- **Estimate:** $11K-15K, 2-3 weeks
- **Question for Fraser:** Stripe Checkout vs custom form? Webhook complexity?

#### 1.7 Course Content Delivery
- **Scope:** Simple course page, external video links, self-mark progress
- **Estimate:** $2K-4K, ~1 week
- **Question for Fraser:** Does this include Creator Dashboard views for certification/payout approval?

### 2. Gap Analysis (15 min)

Three potential gaps identified in session today:

#### Gap 1: Certification Workflow

**Described in user journey but possibly not budgeted:**
```
Student-Teacher clicks [Recommend for Certification]
→ Creator sees request in dashboard
→ Creator clicks [Approve Certification]
→ Certificate issued to student
```

**Question for Fraser:**
- Is this UI included in Course Content ($2K-4K)?
- If not, what's the additional cost?
- Could we handle this semi-manually for Genesis? (ST emails Creator, Creator updates system)

#### Gap 2: Student-Teacher Application Workflow

**Described in user journey but possibly not budgeted:**
```
Student clicks [Apply to Teach This Course]
→ Creator sees application in dashboard
→ Creator clicks [Approve as Student-Teacher]
→ Student can now set availability and teach
```

**Question for Fraser:**
- Is this included in Student Profile System ($14K-18.7K)?
- If not, what's the additional cost?
- Could Brian/Creator manually update roles for Genesis?

#### Gap 3: Student Dashboard/Home

**After login, what does student see?**
- Enrolled courses
- Next upcoming session
- Progress at a glance
- Quick action buttons

**Question for Fraser:**
- Is a unified student home view included in existing estimates?
- Or does student navigate directly to Course Page / Calendar / Profile?
- What's minimal viable landing experience?

**Estimated gap budget:** $2K-4K total (if needed)

### 3. Technical Validation (15 min)

**Questions for Fraser:**

#### Architecture
1. What's the overall tech stack you're planning?
2. Any concerns about integrating BBB + GetStream + Stripe?
3. Database: PostgreSQL? Schema concerns?

#### Timeline
4. Is 4 months (Dec 6 → Apr 1) realistic for this scope?
5. What's the build sequence? (What first, what last?)
6. Any features that could slip to Phase 2 if needed?

#### Risk Assessment
7. What's the riskiest feature to build?
8. Any technical blockers you foresee?
9. What would you cut first if timeline gets tight?

#### Dependencies
10. What do you need from Brian to start? (Stripe account, BBB account, etc.)
11. Any third-party signups needed?

---

### 4. Strategic Alignment (10 min)

**Questions for Gabriel:**

#### Hypothesis Coverage
1. Looking at the 8 features, do you see gaps in hypothesis validation?
2. Brian's top uncertainty is H6 (Flywheel) - is Student Profile System enough to test this?
3. H5 (Peer Teaching Quality) has no direct feature - is manual feedback collection acceptable?

#### Prioritization
4. If budget gets tight, what would you cut?
5. What's the ONE feature that must be perfect vs "good enough"?

#### Risk
6. What's the biggest risk to Genesis cohort success?
7. Any concerns about the Dec 6 → Apr 1 timeline?

### 5. Decisions Needed (10 min)

| Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Calendar/Scheduling approach | Cal.com (B) vs Custom (D) vs Google (E) | Fraser to recommend |
| Gap 1: Certification workflow | Include in MVP vs Manual for Genesis | Likely manual OK |
| Gap 2: ST Application workflow | Include in MVP vs Manual for Genesis | Likely manual OK |
| Gap 3: Student Dashboard | Build minimal vs Defer | Need Fraser input |
| Session Quality Tracking (H5) | Build rating system vs Manual feedback | Manual OK for Genesis |
