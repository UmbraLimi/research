# Brian's MVP Spec Decision-Making Context

**Role:** Founder & CEO of PeerLoop
**Current Challenge:** Finalize MVP specification by December 6, 2025
**Tool:** Q-Command System for decision-making
**Coach:** Gabriel Rymberg

---

## What is PeerLoop?

A peer-to-peer learning platform solving Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem through a "Learn, Teach, Earn" flywheel:

**The Model:**
- Expert creates course and teaches Student A
- Student A masters material and becomes certified Student-Teacher
- Student-Teacher teaches Student B (and earns 70% of tuition)
- Student B becomes Student-Teacher, teaches Student C
- Exponential growth of knowledge transmission

**Revenue Split:**
- 70% → Student-Teacher (the peer teacher)
- 15% → Creator (the expert who made the course)
- 15% → Platform (PeerLoop)

**The Promise:** Makes 1-on-1 tutoring economically scalable and affordable.

## The MVP Challenge

**Goal:** Finalize MVP spec by **December 6, 2025**

**The Question:** What features MUST be in MVP to validate our six core hypotheses?

**The Constraints:**
- Budget: $75K for Phase 1 (Polished Concierge MVP)
- Timeline: ~4 months build time
- Team: Fraser (solo full-stack developer), Guy (AI integration), Gabriel (first course creator), 2-3 additional creators
- Approach: Polished frontend (professional appearance) + Manual backend (Brian operates behind scenes)

---

## The Six Core Hypotheses (MUST VALIDATE IN MVP)

Our entire business model depends on validating these assumptions:

1. **Market Positioning Hypothesis**
   - Students will pay tutoring prices ($300-600 for a course)
   - Test: Do Genesis students actually pay?

2. **Completion Rates Hypothesis**
   - We'll achieve 75%+ completion (vs 10-20% for MOOCs)
   - Test: How many Genesis students finish the course?

3. **Customer Segmentation Hypothesis**
   - We'll attract BOTH "Earn-While-Learn" students AND "Premium Learner-Only" students
   - Test: What ratio of each type enrolls?

4. **Conversion to Teaching Hypothesis**
   - 10%+ of students will become Student-Teachers
   - Test: How many Genesis students choose to teach?

5. **Peer Teaching Quality Hypothesis**
   - Student-Teachers can match expert outcomes
   - Test: Do students taught by Student-Teachers learn as well?

6. **Flywheel Validation Hypothesis**
   - Second generation emerges (Student-Teachers recruit new students)
   - Test: Do Student-Teachers actually recruit and teach?

**Brian's Uncertainty Ranking (from Session 1):**
1. MOST uncertain: Will Student-Teachers recruit 2+ students?
2. Will second generation emerge?
3. Will students pay $400-600?

## What is an MVP? (Critical Definition)

**MVP = Minimum Viable Product**

NOT:
- ❌ A prototype or proof-of-concept
- ❌ A scaled-down version of the full vision
- ❌ A feature-complete product with bugs

IS:
- ✅ A functioning product real customers will pay for
- ✅ Tests the riskiest assumptions
- ✅ Delivers core value proposition
- ✅ Provides maximum learning with minimum investment

**For PeerLoop, MVP means:**
- Genesis cohort (60-80 students across 4-5 courses) can enroll, pay, learn, and become Student-Teachers
- Multi-creator marketplace (4-5 creators each with their own course and moderator)
- We collect enough data to validate or invalidate the six hypotheses
- Manual operations are acceptable where appropriate (Brian handles behind scenes)
- Professional appearance matters (students must trust the platform)

---

## The Polished Concierge Approach (Phase 1)

**What Users SEE (Professional):**
- Professional branding, logo, landing pages
- Stripe payment integration
- Course enrollment and payment flow
- Student dashboard (track progress)
- Communication with Student-Teacher
- Professional certificates upon completion

**What Happens BEHIND Scenes (Manual):**
- Brian manually matches students with Student-Teachers
- Brian manually tracks progress in spreadsheets
- Brian manually grants certifications
- Brian manually handles payouts (PayPal/Venmo)
- Brian personally follows up for feedback

**Why This Approach:**
- Validates hypotheses with meaningful scale (60-80 students vs 30)
- Multi-creator from Day 1 (tests marketplace dynamics)
- Still uses manual operations where appropriate (flexibility to pivot)
- Focus on learning and community, not unnecessary technology

## Decision-Making Framework for MVP Spec

When deciding if a feature should be in MVP, ask:

### MUST HAVE (Include in MVP):
- Does it DIRECTLY validate one of the six hypotheses?
- Is it CRITICAL for Genesis cohort to enroll and pay?
- Can we NOT test our model without it?
- Would students lose trust if it's missing?

**Examples:**
- Payment processing (validates Hypothesis #1)
- Course content delivery (validates Hypothesis #2)
- Student-Teacher matching (validates Hypothesis #4)
- Progress tracking (validates Hypothesis #5)

### NICE TO HAVE (Consider, but not critical):
- Does it improve the experience but isn't required for validation?
- Can we work around it manually for Genesis cohort?
- Would it help retention but not affect initial enrollment?

**Examples:**
- Automated scheduling (Brian can schedule manually)
- Community forum (can use Discord instead)
- Advanced analytics (Brian can track in spreadsheets)

### OUT OF SCOPE (Save for Phase 2):
- Is it optimization for scale (not needed for 30 students)?
- Is it a "nice to have" for future users?
- Does it add complexity without validating hypotheses?

**Examples:**
- Multiple creators/courses (start with Gabriel/Guy's courses only)
- Mobile app (web-first is fine)
- Automated quality control (Brian reviews manually)
- Marketing automation (Brian recruits manually)

## Brian's Strengths & Constraints (From Session 1)

### Strengths:
- **Domain expertise:** 15 years researching pedagogy, learning science, Bloom's 2 Sigma
- **Philosophical depth:** Synthesized Course in Miracles + Urantia Book + learning theory
- **Full-time commitment:** 8-10 hours/day available for PeerLoop
- **Financial stability:** Family business income provides runway
- **Self-awareness:** "I'm a startup guy, not a long-term guy. I like the hunt, not the daily routine"
- **Proactive problem-solver:** Found Jack for communications, education friend for logistics

### Constraints:
- **Core fear:** Wasting money on wrong features (has happened "multiple times" before)
- **Decision-making pattern:** Tendency to wait for perfect information instead of deciding with 70%
- **Public speaking:** "My nerves are short" (but has Jack to help)
- **Prefers startup phase:** Admits he doesn't like "daily routine" - will need operational support later

### Key Quote:
> "I'm a good startup guy. I'm not a good long-term guy. I like the hunt. I like the chase. I don't like the daily routine."

**Implication for MVP:** Focus on startup/validation features. Don't build for scale yet. Brian will bring in operational co-founder after validation (Month 12+).

## Critical Questions Brian Needs to Decide

### For Fraser Meeting (By Dec 2):

1. **Feature Scope:**
   - What are the MUST HAVE features for MVP?
   - What can be done manually (concierge) vs needs automation?
   - What's out of scope for Phase 1?

2. **Student-Teacher Support:**
   - How do we support Student-Teachers with minimal tech?
   - What tools do they need to teach effectively?
   - How much can be manual coaching from Brian vs platform features?

3. **Data Collection:**
   - What data MUST we collect to validate the six hypotheses?
   - What analytics are needed vs nice-to-have?

4. **Professional Appearance:**
   - What does "polished professional" look like to students?
   - Where can we cut corners without losing trust?

5. **Payment & Enrollment:**
   - What's the enrollment flow? (Landing page → Payment → Access)
   - When do Student-Teachers get paid? (Immediately? After student completes?)
   - How do we handle refunds/failures?

### For Student Acquisition (After spec is done):

6. **Genesis Cohort Recruitment:**
   - Where do we find first 30 students?
   - What's the offer/messaging?
   - How much should we charge Genesis students? (Discount? Full price?)

7. **Creator Recruitment:**
   - Beyond Gabriel/Guy, who creates Course #4, #5, etc.?
   - When do we recruit them? (After validation? During?)

---

## How to Use This Context

**When you start a Q-session:**
1. Type `Q-BEGIN`
2. Claude reads this document and understands your situation
3. Tell Claude which decision you're working on
4. Claude helps you think through options using the framework above
5. You make the decision (Claude doesn't decide for you)
6. Type `Q-END` to save your work

**Example Q-session topics:**
- "Help me decide: What features are MUST HAVE for MVP?"
- "I'm meeting Fraser on Tuesday. What questions should I ask him?"
- "Should automated scheduling be in MVP or can I do it manually?"
- "How do I recruit the first 30 Genesis students?"
- "What should I charge for the first course?"

**Remember:**
- You're making decisions with 70% information (not 100%)
- Imperfect action beats perfect planning
- The goal is learning, not perfection
- Manual/concierge is BETTER than automated (for Genesis cohort)

---

## Success Criteria for MVP Spec

**By December 6, Brian has:**
- ✅ Clear list of MUST HAVE features
- ✅ Clear list of NICE TO HAVE features
- ✅ Clear list of OUT OF SCOPE features
- ✅ Fraser has committed to timeline
- ✅ Spec document written and shared with team
- ✅ Everyone aligned and ready to build

**The forcing function:**
Dec 6 deadline creates urgency → Forces prioritization → Drives decisions → Enables action

## Context Monitoring Protocol

**IMPORTANT:** Monitor context usage proactively throughout sessions.

**Brian's Requirement (2025-11-30):** Proactive warnings to avoid context-related data loss.

**Implementation:**
- Add context status every ~10 responses or when approaching limits
- Format: `📊 Context: [X]% | [Status + Recommendation]`

**Thresholds:**
- 📊 **0-70%:** "Healthy" - Continue normally
- ⚠️ **70-85%:** "Consider Q-CHECKPOINT soon" - Plan checkpoint after current task
- 🚨 **85-90%:** "Q-CHECKPOINT recommended NOW" - Checkpoint immediately
- 🆘 **90%+:** "Use Q-SAVE immediately" - Emergency exit, don't risk Q-END

**Rationale:** 
- Q-END at high context may fail mid-execution
- Q-SAVE guarantees basic data saved vs total loss
- Proactive checkpointing prevents emergency situations
- Brian prefers warnings over surprises

---

## Session Status Footer

**IMPORTANT:** Add compact status footer to EVERY response.

**Brian's Requirement (2025-11-30):** Always show current session state at end of each response.

**Format:**
```
─────────────────────────────────────
📊 [Q-COMMAND]: [Feature/Task] | [Phase] | Context: [X]% [Status]
Last: [Last action] → Next: [Next step]
─────────────────────────────────────
```

**Always Include:**
- Current Q-command active (Q-DECIDE, Q-BEGIN, Q-CHECKPOINT, etc.)
- What we're working on (feature name, decision, task)
- Current phase (Analysis, Decision, Implementation, etc.)
- Context usage % with status icon
- Last action taken
- Next step recommendation

**Example:**
```
─────────────────────────────────────
📊 Q-DECIDE: Creator Profiles | Analysis Phase | Context: 27% ✓
Last: Listed options → Next: Select feature
─────────────────────────────────────
```

**Rationale:**
- Brian can always see current state without asking
- Easy to resume after interruptions
- Clear progress tracking throughout session

---

## Visual Request Dividers

**IMPORTANT:** Add visual divider line at the START of every response.

**Brian's Requirement (2025-12-02):** Add a prominent divider line at the beginning of each response so Brian can easily scroll back and find where his requests were made. Text gets buried in long responses.

**Format:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📨 **BRIAN'S REQUEST:** [Brief summary of what Brian asked]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Response content here...]
```

**Implementation:**
- Use thick line characters (━) for high visibility
- Include brief summary of Brian's request
- Place at VERY TOP of every response
- Makes scrolling back easy to find request boundaries

**Rationale:**
- Long responses bury Brian's original requests
- Easy visual marker for scrolling backwards
- Quick identification of conversation flow
- Reduces cognitive load when reviewing session

---

**This context is read by Claude every time Brian starts a Q-session on MVP decisions.**

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-02 (Added visual request dividers protocol)
