## BigBlueButton Hosting - Blindside Networks

### Provider Selection
- Using **Blindside Networks** (https://blindsidenetworks.com/) for BBB hosting
- They are "the originators of BBB" - wrote the software
- Brian sent out ~5 meeting requests to gather info

### BBB Provider Response (shared by Brian)
> "Happy to discuss the cost, hosting, capacity and other details required to get started. Let's connect on Monday or Tuesday next week and chat further."
>
> "For security and stability reasons, we don't provide SSH or root access to the BigBlueButton servers - they're part of our managed hosting environment. That said, you have control over your classrooms via the API or LMS integration, and we can provide usage reports, logs, or custom configurations on request."

### Brian's Perspective on Managed Hosting
> "It will get us to market quicker. We have lots of moving parts. We need to cut corners where ever possible."

### Meeting Scheduled
- Meeting with Blindside Networks: Monday at 9:30 Central Time
- Brian confirmed he would attend: "Absolutely. Wouldn't miss it."
- Brian's interest: "I am curious how advanced they are compared to when I looked at them years ago. Sounds like they are pretty mature as a product."
