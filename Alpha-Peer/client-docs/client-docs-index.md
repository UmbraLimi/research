**Date Uploaded:** 2025-11-30
**Original Date:** 2025-11-13
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Client Slack message clarifying technology preferences and MVP priorities for the social feed component.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **Technology Decision:** GetStream.io mentioned as preferred solution for algorithmic feed
  - Specifically wants the "feed option" from GetStream
  - Target UX: X.com, Skool.com, Substack.com style feeds
  - Purpose: "users to gather in a common area and see relevant posts based on their interests"

- **MVP Requirements (client's stated priorities):**
  1. Profiles
  2. Payments
  3. Calendar options
  4. Algorithmic feed (interest-based content)

- **Discord Evaluation:**
  - Acceptable as temporary solution for initial technical users
  - Client explicitly states: "I really don't like the idea of discord"
  - "would be ok for technical users who we will target initially"
  - Must be replaced by in-site X.com-style feed "in the near future"
  - Discord is a compromise, not a preference

- **Feed Vision:**
  - Common gathering area for users
  - Interest-based content relevance ("relevant posts based on their interests")
  - Social media-style engagement pattern (X.com, Skool.com, Substack.com)

**Technical Implications:**
- GetStream.io integration for activity feeds (or equivalent)
- Interest/preference system for algorithmic content delivery
- Profile system must support feed interactions
- Calendar integration for scheduling
- Payment processing for transactions

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- Reinforces CD-002's "Algorithmic X.com-Style Feed" requirement
- Provides specific technology choice (GetStream.io) vs CD-002's mention of Bluesky protocol
- **Chronology Note:** This message (Nov 13) predates CD-002 (Nov 29)
- **⚠️ Requires Clarification:** GetStream.io vs Bluesky protocol—which is current preference? Later document (CD-002) typically takes precedence, but Stream is already marked REQUIRED in tech research

**Goals Referenced:** GO-010 (Community & Engagement Features)
**Stories Referenced:** US-S025, US-P002

### CD-006: Slack Message - Calendar, BBB, Discord Discussion
**Date Uploaded:** 2025-11-30
**Original Date:** 2025-11-16
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Client Slack message clarifying infrastructure priorities and technology decisions for scheduling, video, and real-time communication.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **Calendar Feature:** "Full blown calendar feature" required
  - Rationale: Avoid manual behind-the-scenes scheduling management
  - Core MVP component alongside profiles
  - Client quote: "we don't have to try and keep up behind the scenes with scheduling"

- **Video Conferencing:** BigBlueButton (BBB) confirmed
  - Use hosted service providers (not self-hosted)
  - Pricing model: Per-session vs per-user (cost savings vs Zoom)
  - Avoids user-paid monthly fees (reduces friction)
  - Client quote: "BBB charges by the session instead of by the user. This is a huge cost savings versus zoom"

- **Real-Time Communication:** Discord accepted as interim solution
  - Alternatives mentioned: Slack, Telegram
  - Users will need to set up external accounts
  - Implies real-time chat is not MVP priority for in-platform build

- **Cost Considerations:**
  - BBB per-session pricing preferred over Zoom per-user pricing
  - Avoiding user-paid monthly fees reduces friction and overhead
  - Hosted BBB services preferred over self-hosting

**Technical Implications:**
- Calendar system must be robust ("full blown")
- BBB integration via hosted provider API
- External chat platform (Discord/Slack/Telegram) for real-time communication initially
- No immediate need to build in-platform real-time chat for MVP

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- Reinforces CD-002's BigBlueButton mention for video sessions
- Reinforces CD-005's Discord as interim solution
- Confirms calendar as MVP priority (also mentioned in CD-005)

### CD-007: Slack Message - BBB Alternatives & P2P Video Research
**Date Uploaded:** 2025-11-30
**Original Date:** 2025-11-18
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Client research on video conferencing alternatives to BBB, specifically optimized for 1:1 peer tutoring sessions.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **P2P Architecture Insight:** For 1:1 sessions, Peer-to-Peer architecture is critical
  - Video data travels directly between devices
  - Bypasses expensive SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) servers
  - Benefits: Lower latency, higher security, significantly lower costs

- **Three Options Evaluated:**

  | Service | Best For | Free Tier | Key Feature |
  |---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
  | Digital Samba | Low code (iframe) | 10,000 mins/mo (~83 hrs 1:1) | Pre-built Zoom-like UI |
  | Daily.co | Developer SDK | 10,000 mins/mo | Auto P2P switching for 1:1 |
  | VideoSDK.live | Scale/cost priority | N/A | $0.003/min (below industry $0.004) |

- **Daily.co Highlighted Feature:** Automatic P2P switching
  - 2 people → P2P mode (efficient)
  - 3+ people → SFU mode (seamless switch)
  - Many competitors always use SFU (inefficient for 1:1)

- **Whereby Warning:** Recently imposed 30-minute limit on free calls (avoid)

- **Client Recommendations:**
  - Digital Samba: Quick integration, no UI code needed
  - Daily.co: Professional SDK with intelligent P2P handling

**Technical Implications:**
- 1:1 tutoring sessions benefit from P2P-optimized solutions
- May reconsider BBB if primarily 1:1 sessions (P2P alternatives more cost-effective)
- Daily.co offers best developer experience with automatic optimization
- Digital Samba offers fastest time-to-market

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- **Potentially supersedes CD-006's BBB preference** for 1:1 use case
- Aligns with CD-006's cost-consciousness (avoiding per-user fees)
- **Chronology:** Nov 18 - after CD-006 (Nov 16), before CD-002 (Nov 29)
- CD-002 still mentions BBB - may be for group sessions vs 1:1

**⚠️ Requires Clarification:**
- Daily.co vs Digital Samba vs BBB - final decision?
- BBB for groups + P2P for 1:1? Or single solution?

**Goals Referenced:** GO-009 (Video Session Infrastructure)
**Stories Referenced:** US-V001, US-V002, US-T007, US-A014

### CD-008: Meeting Transcript - Budget, Timeline, Community Feed
**Date Uploaded:** 2025-11-30
**Original Date:** 2025-11-26
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Meeting transcript capturing Brian's (client) stated positions on budget, timeline, and community feed priorities.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **Budget & Timeline (NEW):**
  - Budget: **$75,000** (increased from earlier conservative estimates)
  - Timeline: **4 months**
  - Client quote: "I want to take a bigger risk"

- **Community Feed - Critical MVP Priority:**
  - Must build now, not later: "would be a nut house after the fact"
  - Fallback value: Even if thesis fails, "I'll have a tutoring site with unique functionality"
  - Purpose: **Marketing funnel** that overcomes resistance to purchase

- **Community Feed as Marketing Funnel (User Journey):**
  1. Student arrives → sees courses → clicks "follow" to explore
  2. Sees creator → clicks "follow"
  3. Subject/course feeds appear in their community feed
  4. Social proof: "I took this course, built this app, got 8 weeks work in a week"
  5. Public discussion of pros/cons
  6. Conversion: "You can talk somebody into the course"
  7. Retention: After course, stay in community to teach others

- **Stream (GetStream.io) - Clarified Scope:**
  - **Feeds only** - not their video conferencing
  - Chat is "much lower on the priority list"
  - Quote: "The community feeds is all I want out of there"

- **Skool.com as Prototype:**
  - Agreed to use Skool as reference for community feed design
  - Quote: "Let's use Skool as the prototype to build our community feed"

- **Core Philosophy - Human Connection:**
  - "People motivate people. Computers don't motivate people."
  - "The human connections are overlooked in this quest to educate people"
  - "Just the one hour paid session is not enough of a connection"
  - Self-paced sites create isolation; community feed combats this

- **Video Conferencing:**
  - Jitsi mentioned as possibility (from Claude/Q feedback)
  - Concern: "doesn't seem like it's quite as full featured"

**Technical Implications:**
- Stream integration scoped to feeds only (reduces complexity)
- Community feed is MVP-critical, not post-launch
- Skool.com UX patterns should inform feed design
- 4-month timeline requires focused scope

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- **Supersedes** earlier budget/timeline assumptions
- **Clarifies** CD-005's Stream mention (feeds only, not chat)
- **Reinforces** CD-005's feed priority
- Adds Jitsi to video options (CD-006, CD-007)
- **Chronology:** Nov 26 - after CD-007 (Nov 18), before CD-002 (Nov 29)

**Goals Referenced:** GO-010, GO-014 (Community & Combat Isolation)
**Stories Referenced:** US-S025, US-P002, US-S001, US-S006

**Date Uploaded:** 2025-12-04
**Prepared:** December 2, 2025
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Comprehensive meeting preparation document for MVP spec review with developer (Fraser) and strategic advisor (Gabriel). Consolidates all 8 decided MVP features with budget and timeline tracking.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **8 MUST HAVE MVP Features (Decided):**

  | # | Feature | Dev Cost | Timeline |
  |---|---------|----------|----------|
  | 1 | Video Conferencing (BBB hosted) | $2.4K-3.6K/yr | - |
  | 2 | Community Feed (getstream.io) | $3.4K-5.7K/yr | - |
  | 3 | Calendar/Scheduling | $1.7K-3.8K | 1-2 weeks |
  | 4 | Student Profile System | $14K-18.7K | 3-4 weeks |
  | 5 | Creator Profiles | $500 | <1 week |
  | 6 | Rebrand to PeerLoop | Complete | Done |
  | 7 | Payment & Escrow | $11K-15K | 2-3 weeks |
  | 8 | Course Content Delivery | $2K-4K | ~1 week |

- **Budget Status:**
  - Phase 1 Budget: **$75,000** (confirms CD-008)
  - Allocated: $46K-62K (61-83%)
  - Remaining: $13K-29K
  - Status: Getting tight

- **Timeline Milestones:**
  - MVP Spec Deadline: **Dec 6, 2025**
  - Build Period: Dec 6 → Apr 1 (~4 months)
  - Genesis Cohort: Apr 1 → Jun 1 (60-80 students)

- **Genesis Cohort Size:** 60-80 students across 4-5 courses (refines earlier "3 creators" estimates)

- **Operational Model Confirmed (Critical for SPECS.md):**
  - **Creators control their courses** - approve certifications, payouts, new Student-Teachers
  - **Brian (Platform) = Strategic oversight only** - ~3-4 hours/week
  - Minimal admin involvement in day-to-day operations

- **Calendar Options Under Consideration:**
  - Cal.com (Option B)
  - Custom react-big-calendar (Option D)
  - Google Calendar API (Option E)

- **Three Potential Gaps Identified:**
  1. **Certification Workflow** - ST recommends → Creator approves → Certificate issued
  2. **Student-Teacher Application Workflow** - Student applies → Creator approves → Can teach
  3. **Student Dashboard/Home** - Enrolled courses, next session, progress, quick actions

- **Gap Budget:** $2K-4K total if needed (or manual for Genesis)

- **6 Hypotheses Being Tested:**

  | # | Hypothesis | Test | Feature Coverage |
  |---|------------|------|------------------|
  | H1 | Students pay $300-600 | Genesis payments | Payment System |
  | H2 | 75%+ completion rate | Track completions | Content Delivery |
  | H3 | Two customer segments | Analyze enrollments | Profile System |
  | H4 | 10%+ become Student-Teachers | Track conversions | Profile System |
  | H5 | Peer teaching matches experts | Quality feedback | **Manual for MVP** |
  | H6 | Flywheel (2+ students recruited) | Track network growth | Profile System |

**Technical Implications:**
- GetStream.io confirmed for Activity Feeds (not chat)
- BBB via hosted provider API (Blindside Networks)
- Semi-automated payment approach (Stripe + manual payout approval)
- Course content: simple pages, external video links, self-mark progress
- Creator Dashboard for certification/payout approval workflows
- Student Dashboard as minimal viable landing experience

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- **Consolidates** CD-008's budget ($75K) and CD-009's BBB/Cloudflare decisions
- **Confirms** GetStream for feeds (CD-005), not chat (CD-008)
- **Refines** Genesis cohort: 60-80 students (vs earlier estimates)
- **Adds** operational model detail: creator-controlled, minimal Brian involvement
- **Identifies** three workflow gaps for prioritization

**Goals Referenced:** GO-001 (flywheel), GO-004 (Genesis), GO-005 (validation metrics), GO-018 (budget/timeline)
**Stories Referenced:** US-C014 (certification), US-S020 (apply for teacher status), US-P003 (dashboard)

  - Automated refund processing
  - Complex escrow conditions
  - Payment plans/installments
  - Tax document generation (1099s)

- **Why Stripe:**
  - Industry standard for SaaS/EdTech
  - Excellent React components and documentation
  - 99.99% uptime, built-in fraud detection
  - PCI compliance handled
  - Easy upgrade path to Stripe Connect in Phase 2
  - Fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (~$14.80 on $500 course)

- **Why Semi-Automated (vs Fully Automated):**
  - Saves $5K-$11K vs fully automated (Stripe Connect)
  - 1-2 hrs/month acceptable for 4-5 creators
  - Brian maintains cash flow oversight
  - Upgrade path exists for Phase 2

- **Semi-Automated Workflow:**
  1. Student pays via Stripe Checkout
  2. System instantly enrolls student
  3. System calculates 70/15/15 split
  4. System tracks amounts owed to each recipient
  5. Monthly: Brian opens Admin Dashboard
  6. Brian clicks "Process Payout" for each recipient
  7. System sends payment via Stripe Transfer or PayPal Payouts API
  8. Recipients receive funds + confirmation

- **Hypothesis Validation:**
  - **H1 (PRIMARY):** Market Positioning - Directly tests if students will pay $400-600
  - **H4:** Conversion to Teaching - 70% payout incentivizes becoming ST
  - **H6:** Flywheel - Revenue share enables sustainable flywheel

- **Success Metrics:**
  - 60-80 students successfully pay $400-600
  - Payment completion rate >90%
  - No major payment-related complaints
  - Student-Teachers receive payouts as promised
  - Recipients receive funds within 2-3 business days

- **Budget Breakdown:**
  | Component | Estimate |
  |-----------|----------|
  | Stripe Integration | $4,000-5,500 |
  | Split Calculation System | $2,500-3,500 |
  | Admin Dashboard | $2,500-3,500 |
  | Payout Processing | $2,000-2,500 |
  | Monthly Operating | ~$50 |
  | Stripe Fees (Genesis) | ~$1,000-1,200 |

**Technical Implications:**
- Stripe Checkout integration (not custom form)
- Webhook setup for payment confirmations
- Database schema for tracking splits and pending payouts
- Admin dashboard for payout management
- Integration with Creator/ST earnings dashboards
- Escrow logic with manual release approval

### CD-024: Meeting Notes - Brian Walkthrough & Flywheel Testing (Dec 15, 2025)
**Date Uploaded:** 2025-12-23
**Original Date:** 2025-12-15
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Meeting notes from Brian's walkthrough of PeerLoopApp prototype, discussing user access states, instructor feeds, and initial flywheel testing plan.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **User Access States (State Machine):**
  - Registered user → can view instructor and their courses
  - Paid for course → access to that course's feed
  - Paid for ANY instructor's course → access to Instructor's public feed
  - Implies tiered access control based on enrollment relationships

- **Instructor Feed (NEW):**
  - Instructors should have a feed for current and former students
  - Distinct from course-specific feeds
  - Provides ongoing community connection after course completion

- **Flywheel Testing Plan:**
  - Gabriel and Guy will create 4 entry-level courses: n8n, GitHub, Claude Code, AI tools
  - Each course: 1-2 sessions with homework
  - Purpose: Test the learn-teach-earn flywheel with real users

- **Onboarding Flow:**
  - Needed for full product
  - NOT for MVP (deferred)

- **Enhanced Gamification (Gabriel's Suggestion):**
  - Point system rewarding participation
  - Points can lead to:
    - Promotions for purchasing courses (discounts)
    - Deals for promoting a message from current feed to the Peer Loop main feed
  - Feed promotion feature: Users can spend points to boost their posts to wider audience

**Technical Implications:**
- User access state machine needed (not just roles, but enrollment-based access levels)
- Instructor-level feeds distinct from course-level feeds
- Feed promotion mechanism (spend points to boost posts)
- Need to track "ever enrolled with instructor" for instructor feed access

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- **Expands** CD-023's Goodwill Points with feed promotion use case
- **Adds** instructor feed concept (not just course feeds)
- **Confirms** 4 courses for Genesis testing (complements CD-012's 4-5 courses estimate)
- **Clarifies** MVP scope: onboarding flow is deferred

**Goals Referenced:** GO-001 (flywheel testing), GO-019 (gamification)
**Stories Added:** US-S069-S071, US-C037-C038, US-P083

### CD-028: Slack - PlugNmeet as BBB Alternative (Dec 24, 2025)
**Date Uploaded:** 2025-12-24
**Type:** Slack Conversation
**Source:** Brian LeBlanc messages after Fraser raised concerns about BBB being "old and dated"
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Brian researched modern alternatives to BigBlueButton after hearing feedback that BBB is outdated. Found **PlugNmeet** as the "Best Modern BBB Replacement."

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **PlugNmeet Overview:**
  - Open-source, built on Go + LiveKit (modern WebRTC)
  - Positions itself as "modern BigBlueButton replacement"
  - Zoom-like interface (vs BBB's clunky UI)
  - Same classroom features as BBB

- **Pricing:**
  - Self-Hosted: Free (just VPS cost $5-10/month) - flat rate
  - Cloud Flex Plan: Flat monthly fee based on concurrent capacity (not per-user)

- **Key Features:**
  - HD video, screen sharing, breakout rooms, waiting rooms
  - Whiteboard (upload PDFs/Office docs)
  - Polls & Voting, Shared Notepad
  - Moderator Controls (lock mics/webcams/chat)
  - AI "Meeting Agent" for live speech-to-text and translations
  - LMS plugins (Moodle, WordPress, Joomla)

- **Scalability Advantages over BBB:**
  - BBB is "monolithic" - heavy, difficult to split across servers
  - PlugNmeet uses microservices architecture
  - Small: Single server handles hundreds of concurrent users
  - Large: Can separate heavy components (recording on separate server)
  - Massive: Cluster media servers for 1,000+ students

- **Status:** Brian to "look deeper" before final decision

**Technical Implications:**
- May replace BBB (DIR-001: MUST-USE BigBlueButton) if evaluation is positive
- Better scalability for growth
- Lower/predictable costs vs per-session fees
- Modern UX aligns with Zoom-like expectations

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- **May supersede** CD-006, CD-007, CD-009, CD-014's BBB decisions

### CD-029: PeerLoop Block Sequence v2.1 - From Zero to Flywheel (Dec 19, 2025)
**Date Uploaded:** 2025-12-24
**Original Date:** 2025-12-19 (v2.2, incorporating Dec 19 UX meeting)
**Author:** Gabriel Rymberg (with Claude)
**Type:** Management Planning Document (HTML with tabs)
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Comprehensive block sequence planning document from Gabriel (project manager) breaking MVP into small, testable, deployable increments while tracking hypothesis validation. Includes user journey narratives, hypothesis definitions, Brian's review comments, Dec 15 meeting updates, and Dec 19 UX meeting insights.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **Six Core Hypotheses (H1-H6):**
  | ID | Hypothesis | Success Criteria | Uncertainty |
  |-----|------------|-----------------|-------------|
  | H1 | Market Positioning: Students pay $300-600 | Complete purchase | Medium-High |
  | H2 | Completion Rates: 75%+ (vs 10-20% MOOCs) | ≥75% completion | Medium |
  | H3 | Customer Segmentation: Both "Earn-While-Learn" and "Premium Learner-Only" | See both segments | Low |
  | H4 | Conversion to Teaching: 10%+ become S-Ts | ≥10% certified apply | Medium-High |
  | H5 | Peer Teaching Quality: Match expert outcomes | Creator approves quality | Medium |
  | H6 | Flywheel Validation: Second generation emerges | S-Ts teach new students | **HIGHEST** |

- **Brian's Top 3 Uncertainties (ranked):**
  1. Will Student-Teachers recruit 2+ students? (MOST uncertain)
  2. Will second-generation emerge?
  3. Will students pay $400-600?

- **Block Sequence Overview (0.x = Flywheel Validation):**
  | Block | Name | Duration | Hypotheses |
  |-------|------|----------|------------|
  | 0.0 | Foundation | 1 week | (Enables all) |
  | 0.1 | Discovery & Payment | 1 week | H1 |
  | 0.2 | Content Access | 1 week | (Enables H2, H5) |
  | 0.3 | Scheduling & Sessions | 1-2 weeks | H5 |
  | 0.4 | Progress & Completion | 1 week | H2 |
  | 0.5 | Certification | 1 week | H2, H5 |
  | 0.6 | Become Student-Teacher | 1 week | H3, H4 |
  | 0.7 | Flywheel & Payouts | 1-2 weeks | H3, H6 |

- **Brian's Review Comments (Critical Insights):**
  1. **Trust-building before payment:** New platform with no reviews needs pre-enrollment communication
  2. **Tiered pricing suggestion:** $150×3 courses vs $450 single payment (lower entry barrier)
  3. **Free 15-minute intro sessions:** Let visitors experience differentiation before committing
  4. **Basic "Contact Creator" feature:** Needed in Block 0.1, not deferred to Block 1.x

- **Dec 15 Meeting Updates:**
  1. **Course access model CHANGED:** Students get community feed access upon PAYMENT, not after graduation
     - Fraser's insight: "You need help after session one, but before session two"
     - Brian: "Having paid access to it makes perfect sense"
  2. **Four starter courses confirmed:** GitHub, Claude Code, n8n, AI Tools Overview (1-2 sessions each)
  3. **States/roles matrix required:** Fraser to create systematic tracking of course-role-state combinations
  4. **Designer trial test:** $500 budget, 10 hours max, 2-day turnaround

- **Dec 19 UX Meeting (Matt McCloskey):**
  1. **"The one-on-one live video instruction is the core value proposition and lynchpin"**
  2. Course-first for MVP, community features secondary
  3. Mobile-first design critical for growth
  4. Validates current block sequence: 0.x (flywheel) before 1.x (community)

- **Actor-Block Matrix:** Maps when each actor gets functionality across blocks
  - 258 total user stories, 135 P0 (MVP critical), ~72 in Block 0.x

- **Timeline:**
  - Block 0.x (Flywheel): ~11 weeks
  - Block 1.x (Community): 4-5 weeks
  - Block 2.x (Polish): 4-6 weeks
  - **Total: 21-24 weeks → Launch May-June 2026**

- **Key Decisions Retained:**
  - Creator approves certs/payouts/S-T apps (not Brian)
  - S-T recommends → Creator approves certification workflow
  - Stripe automated payouts (after Creator approval)
  - Brian's time: 3-4 hrs/week (strategic only)

**Technical Implications:**
- Pre-enrollment communication feature needed earlier than planned (Block 0.1 or 0.2)
- Course community feed access upon payment requires enrollment-triggered access control
- States/roles matrix informs permission system design
- Mobile-first responsive design requirement

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- **Consolidates** CD-001 through CD-028 into actionable development sequence
- **Validates** architecture decisions from MVP decision docs (CD-013 through CD-020)
- **Confirms** 4 starter courses (complements CD-025, CD-026)
- **Adds** Brian's critical feedback on trust-building gap
- **Adds** Matt McCloskey's UX validation of video-first approach

**Goals Referenced:** GO-001 (flywheel), GO-002 (2 Sigma), GO-004 (Genesis cohort), GO-005 (validation metrics), GO-006 (engagement), GO-014 (combat isolation), GO-018 (budget/timeline)
**Goals Added:** GO-021 (Trust-Building Before Purchase)
**Stories Implied:** Trust-building stories, tiered pricing stories, free intro session stories

**Date Uploaded:** 2025-12-24
**Original Date:** 2025-12-07
**Author:** Brian + Claude (Q-Command System)
**Status:** APPROVED
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Quick reference document with user journey narratives and one-page story summary. Provides high-level view of all actors' journeys and story counts by category.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **User Journey Narratives for 7 Actor Types:**
  1. **Student (Sarah):** Browse → enroll ($450) → schedule → learn (BBB sessions + content) → complete → certify → apply to become S-T → teach others
  2. **Student-Teacher (Marcus):** Set availability → receive bookings → conduct sessions → guide students → recommend for certification → receive 70% payout
  3. **Creator (Guy):** Work with Brian to set up course → monitor dashboard → approve certifications/payouts/S-T apps → earn 15% royalty
  4. **Admin (Brian):** Onboard creators → monitor platform → handle exceptions → 3-4 hrs/week strategic oversight
  5. **Visitor:** View value proposition → browse courses/creators without login → sign up when enrolling
  6. **Community Moderator:** Monitor feed → answer questions → delete/ban → pin announcements → manage flagged queue
  7. **Employer/Funder:** Pay for employee enrollment → receive progress updates → get certification copy

- **One-Page Story Summary:**
  | Actor | Stories | Notes |
  |-------|---------|-------|
  | Visitor (Pre-Login) | 15 | Homepage, courses, auth |
  | Student | 56 | P0: pay, content, sessions, dashboard; P0 Block 2: S-T application, certificates |
  | Student-Teacher | 23 | P0: availability, students, sessions, payouts |
  | Creator | 36 | P0: students, S-Ts, sessions, approvals |
  | Admin (Brian) | 29 | P0: onboard, refunds, Stripe |
  | System/Platform | 84 | Auth, payments, video, email, calendar, progress, messaging, feed |
  | Community Moderator | 9 | Delete posts, flagged queue |
  | Employer/Funder | 6 | All P1 |
  | **TOTAL** | **258** | **135 P0 (MVP Critical)** |

- **Timeline (Full 135 P0 Scope):**
  | Phase | Weeks | What's Done |
  |-------|-------|-------------|
  | Block 1 | 4-5 | Core flow + basic messaging |
  | Block 2 | 4-5 | Community feed + profiles |
  | Block 3 | 4-6 | Full features + polish |
  | Buffer | 2 | Testing |
  | **TOTAL** | **14-18** | **Launch: April-May 2026** |

  ```
  Student enrolls ($450) → Learns from S-T → Completes → S-T recommends → Creator certifies
  → Creator approves payout → 70/15/15 split via Stripe → Student becomes S-T → Teaches new students → Cycle repeats
  ```

**Timeline Note:**
- CD-031 shows 14-18 weeks / April-May 2026 launch
- CD-029 shows 21-24 weeks / May-June 2026 launch
- Difference: CD-031 covers P0 scope only; CD-029 includes community and polish blocks

**Story Count Note:**
- CD-031 shows 258 total / 135 P0
- USER-STORIES.md shows 299 total / 139 P0

### CD-032: Fraser's Meeting Notes (Nov 9 - Dec 24, 2025)
**Date Uploaded:** 2025-12-24
**Original Date:** 2025-11-09 to 2025-12-24
**Author:** Fraser (Developer)
**Type:** Compiled Meeting Notes
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Developer's personal notes from meetings and observations over the project timeline. Contains valuable context, decisions, and open questions not fully captured in formal documents.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **Creator Pricing Model (Nov 21) - NEW:**
  - Monthly subscription fee for creators
  - Per-course fee for each course
  - **Lifetime membership for first 10-20 creators** (early adopter incentive)
  - AppSumo launch consideration for bootstrapping community

- **Platform Philosophy (Nov 20):**
  - 80% focus on education/giving to public, 20% on monetization
  - Not worried about going viral - will be a good business regardless

- **Product Naming (Dec 22) - NEW:**
  - Brian doesn't like "tutoring" - prefers "skills taught from people just ahead of you"
  - Teaching moves learner from 70% to 80% mastery
  - Gabriel: Call it a "platform" not an "app"
  - Fraser's suggestion: "Personalized transfer of skills platform"
  - **Learning split:** 50% non-expert tutoring, 50% social interaction through feeds/challenges

- **Architecture Decisions (Nov 24):**
  - BBB and Stream as **backend services** to custom frontend
  - Create as little new stuff as possible while looking professional
  - Keep costs down until site pays for itself, then go fully custom
  - Eventually may have 3 developers working for Fraser
  - Invitation-only launch to control reception and create buzz

- **Feed Companion UI (Nov 26 + Dec 24) - NEW:**
  - User feed showing 10 most recent posters with 24hr count
  - Pinnable authors/posts to track specific content
  - AI Chat component in feed - users can ask for what they want to see
  - **Feed noise solution:** Pin a post → show original + latest thread comment only
  - Privacy: Clear policy, NOT using AI to mine user discussions

- **Onboarding Process (Nov 26) - NEW:**
  - Need onboarding to get initial interests from users
  - AI can suggest courses/teachers/students over time (with privacy in mind)

- **Timeline Reality (Dec 10) - CONFLICTS:**
  - Fraser believes 6 months more realistic than 4 months
  - Budget ($75K) OK at present

- **Page Architecture (Dec 22) - NEW:**
  - 3 basic page types:
    1. **Public-facing:** Predictable layout, CTAs to get signups
    2. **User-facing:** After login
    3. **Admin pages:** Just for Brian
  - Could be subdomains or folders under main domain

- **Additional Features Mentioned:**
  - **Changelog page** (Dec 5) - add to site
  - **Feature flags** (Dec 24) - hide features behind flags
  - **ICS export** (Dec 10) - export calendar to Google/Outlook/Apple via email
  - **Course promotion** (Dec 24) - paid promotion into feeds, basic promotion free
  - **Sub-communities** (Dec 24) - users may want to create and invite others
  - **Custom coaching/mentoring** (Dec 24) - revenue stream for students needing extra help

- **Unified Dashboard (Dec 24) - CLARIFICATION:**
  - User can have multiple roles simultaneously (student, guest, student-teacher, teacher)
  - Dashboard should show all roles on common dashboard
  - NOT separate logins per role
  - Roles isolated and interconnected as needed

- **Open Questions (Dec 24):**
  1. **S-T Pricing Visibility:** How do new students see S-T prices before buying course?
     - Students buy course from Teacher but S-Ts have cheaper rates they never see
     - Need to resolve: how do students find/evaluate S-Ts before buying?
  2. **Course Passing:** How do students "pass" a course? What are the criteria?
  3. **Moderator Invites:** Moderators need login + invite from Teacher to moderate feeds

**Technical Implications:**
- Feature flag system needed for hiding features
- Onboarding flow for interest collection
- Feed companion/pinning UI component
- AI chat integration in feed
- Sub-community creation capability
- Changelog page
- 3-tier page architecture (public/user/admin)

**Relationship to Other Docs:**
- **Reinforces** CD-005, CD-008 (Stream for feeds, BBB for video)
- **Adds** creator pricing model not in other docs
- **Adds** feed companion UI concept
- **Adds** onboarding process requirement
- **Clarifies** unified dashboard vs separate role logins
- **Raises** timeline concern (6 months vs 4 months)

**Goals Referenced:** GO-003 (sustainable income - creator pricing), GO-010 (community features - feed companion), GO-019 (gamification - noted)
**Goals Implied:** Creator subscription model, feature flag system, onboarding process
**Stories Implied:** 15+ new stories (feed companion, onboarding, changelog, sub-communities, extra coaching, course promotion, feature flags)

### CD-033: Slack - S-T Pricing Clarification
**Date Uploaded:** 2025-12-24
**Source:** Slack conversation between Fraser Gorrie and Brian LeBlanc
**Type:** Clarification / Decision
**Summary for SPECS.md:**

Real-time Slack conversation resolving Question #23 about Student-Teacher pricing visibility. Contains critical pricing model decisions.

**Key elements for SPECS.md:**

- **Unified Pricing Model (CONFIRMED) - CRITICAL:**
  - **Course price IS the S-T price** - no separate Teacher premium
  - Creator prices course as if they're NOT the primary teacher
  - "Too complicated for the creator to charge premium. Too confusing."
  - Question #23 resolved: no hidden pricing because displayed price already reflects S-T level

- **Revenue Split (CONFIRMED):**
  - **85/15 split** (platform takes 15%)
  - Example: $450 course → $67.50 site, $67.50 creator, $315 adjustable (S-T share)
  - When creator teaches: creator earns full amount (minus platform fee)

- **Enrollment Flow (CLARIFIED):**
  1. Student finds course, clicks for detail
  2. Clicks Enroll button
  3. Sees **calendar with dots** showing S-T availability
  4. **S-T list with times** displayed below calendar
  5. Click S-T for detail OR click time to purchase
  6. **"Schedule Later" button** available
  7. After purchase: access to course feed + booking rights

- **Creator Teaching Role (CLARIFIED):**
  - Creator can teach but will reduce as network grows
  - Creator charges **same fee as S-Ts** (no premium)
  - Creator's job: "prime the pump" - teach initially, certify S-Ts
  - Community takes over teaching over time

- **Refund Policy (NEW):**
  - Students can bail at **any time** and get a refund
  - "The pressure is on the student teacher to earn his pay"

- **S-T Discount Option (POSTPONED):**
  - Initially discussed: S-Ts could teach at discount/free to gain experience
  - Concern: "bidding war" might "cheapen the experience"
  - Decision: Defer for MVP, see if quality S-T experience holds up

**Technical Implications:**
- Course detail page needs S-T availability calendar view
- Single price point per course simplifies payment logic
- Refund system required with any-time cancellation
- No need for price comparison UI (single price)
