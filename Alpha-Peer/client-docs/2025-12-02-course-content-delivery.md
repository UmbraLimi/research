## Hypothesis Validation

| Hypothesis | Impact | Explanation |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| H1: Market Positioning | ⚠️ Indirect | Professional content = perceived value |
| **H2: Completion Rates** | ✅ **PRIMARY** | This IS how students complete the course |
| H3: Customer Segmentation | ❌ No | |
| H4: Conversion to Teaching | ✅ Yes | Path to certification = become Student-Teacher |
| H5: Peer Teaching Quality | ⚠️ Indirect | Content consistency across Student-Teachers |
| H6: Flywheel | ❌ No | |

**Validation Score:** HIGH - Directly validates H2 (75% completion promise) and H4 (conversion to teaching)

## Role Clarification (Important!)

This decision clarified the operational model:

### Creator (e.g., Guy) Controls Their Course:
| Action | Creator Does It |
|--------|-----------------|
| Creates course content | ✅ |
| Approves certifications | ✅ |
| Approves payouts | ✅ |
| Approves new Student-Teachers | ✅ |

### Brian (Platform Owner) - Strategic Only:
| Action | Brian Does It |
|--------|---------------|
| Recruits/onboards Creators | ✅ |
| Platform-level disputes | ✅ |
| Monitors overall health | ✅ |
| Day-to-day course ops | ❌ |
