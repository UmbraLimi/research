# Questions for Brian

**Purpose:** Consolidated list of all open questions requiring Brian's input, organized by source document.

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-24

## From CD-005: Slack - GetStream Feed Discussion

1. **GetStream.io vs Bluesky protocol** - CD-002 (Nov 29) mentions Bluesky protocol for community, but CD-005 (Nov 13) mentions GetStream.io. CD-008 clarified "feeds only" from Stream. Is Bluesky still in consideration, or is GetStream.io the confirmed choice?

---

## From CD-007 & CD-028: Video Platform Decision

> **UPDATE (2025-12-24):** Questions #2-4 are now **non-blocking** due to architectural decision. See `API.md` → "Video Platform Interface Contract". The video platform is abstracted behind an interface - any compliant provider (BBB, PlugNmeet, Daily.co) can be selected during implementation without affecting core architecture.

2. ~~**Video platform final decision**~~ → **DEFERRED TO IMPLEMENTATION** - Interface contract defined in API.md. Provider selection can happen later based on cost/hosting preferences.

3. ~~**PlugNmeet evaluation status**~~ → **DEFERRED TO IMPLEMENTATION** - PlugNmeet can be evaluated against the VideoProvider interface during implementation. DIR-001 may be updated to "MUST-USE VideoProvider-compliant platform".

4. **Single platform or hybrid?** - Interface allows for multiple providers if needed. Decision can be made during implementation based on cost analysis.

## From CD-010: Miro Board - Main Activities by Role

5. **Newsletter with subscription payments** - Is a paid newsletter feature planned? Document mentions "Newsletter possibility with subscription payments" as a question.

---

## From CD-011: Miro Board - Drivers & Action Items

6. **AI Assistant technology** - Document lists AI Assistant for Students as "TBD". What is the scope and technology choice for AI assistance? MVP or post-MVP?

7. **Newsletters technology** - Document lists Newsletters as "TBD". What is the scope for newsletters? Is this related to the paid newsletter question in CD-010?

8. **Bluesky vs GetStream.io** - CD-011 explicitly mentions Bluesky for community tool, but CD-005/CD-008/CD-013 confirm GetStream.io for feeds. Which is correct? Are both used for different purposes?

9. **Certificate of Mastery vs Completion** - Document mentions two certificate types. What's the difference? How does a student earn Mastery vs Completion? Is Mastery MVP or post-MVP?

---

## From CD-018: Student Profile System

10. **Profile visibility default** - Should new profiles default to Public or Private? Document notes "default TBD".

## From CD-027: Prototype Walkthrough

### Community & Feed Structure
11. **Community Structure** - Is instructor community the same as `instructor_followers` from CD-024, or a separate entity?

12. **Channels within Communities** - Are "Everyone" and "creator-2" (seen in post badges) channels/sub-groups, or test artifacts?

13. **Auto-join Rules** - Which communities do new users automatically join? Just Town Hall, or also some instructors?

14. **Course vs Instructor Feed Access** - User pays for course → gets course feed access. User pays for ANY course from instructor → gets instructor feed access. Is this correct?

### Sessions & Availability
15. **Availability States** - Just Available/Unavailable, or more states (Busy, Away, etc.)?

16. **Session Booking Integration** - Is booking calendar-first (schedule then get BBB/PlugNmeet link), or video-platform-first?

17. **Group Sessions** - Are group sessions (4+ students) part of MVP? Prototype shows "Group Session · 4 students" in Teaching Dashboard.

### Role-Specific Features
18. **Creator Dashboard** - Does Creator need a separate "Creator Studio" or third tab beyond Learning/Teaching? Currently Creator shows identical view to Student-Teacher.

19. **Admin Features** - What admin capabilities are needed for MVP vs post-MVP? Current prototype has no admin implementation.

### Course Content
20. **Homework System** - Is homework submission/grading part of MVP? Prototype shows detailed homework tracking with due dates and scores.

21. **Session Resources** - Are per-session resources (Recording, Slides, Code Files) stored in platform or external links (like course content)?

### UX Decisions
22. **User Menu in Header** - Confirm need for header user dropdown with avatar, settings, logout? Currently missing from prototype.

## From CD-032: Fraser Meeting Notes (Dec 24 Observations)

### Student-Teacher Pricing Visibility
23. ~~**S-T Pricing Before Purchase**~~ → **RESOLVED (CD-033)** - The course price **IS** the S-T price. Creators price courses as if they're NOT the primary teacher. There is no separate Teacher premium pricing. This eliminates the "hidden pricing" concern entirely.

> **Key clarifications from CD-033:**
> - Unified pricing model: single price point per course
> - Creator charges same as S-Ts (no premium)
> - 85/15 revenue split (platform/creator+S-T)
> - Enrollment flow shows S-T availability calendar before purchase
> - "Schedule Later" option available after purchase
> - Students can refund at any time

### Course Completion Criteria
24. **How do students "pass" a course?** - What are the criteria for completing/passing a course?
    - Is it self-reported progress (checkboxes)?
    - Is it S-T recommendation + Creator approval (as documented)?
    - Is there a minimum number of sessions?
    - What happens if a student can't pass in allotted sessions?

### Moderator Mechanics
25. **Moderator Invite System** - How does a Teacher invite a Moderator?
    - Is there an invite link/code?
    - Can a Moderator be assigned to specific feeds (Teacher feed, course feed, or both)?
    - What is the onboarding flow for Moderators?

### Timeline Concern
26. ~~**6 Months vs 4 Months**~~ → **RESOLVED** - Brian confirms **4 months is the goal**. Strategy: Practice feature removal if scope doesn't fit. Timeline is fixed; features are flexible.
