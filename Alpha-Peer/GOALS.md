## Mission Statement

Launch Alpha Peer as a functioning peer-to-peer learning platform for AI education that solves the "2 Sigma Problem" by democratizing 1-on-1 tutoring. Validate that students who complete courses transition to paid Student-Teachers, proving the learn-teach-earn flywheel creates self-sustaining teaching capacity and genuinely better learning outcomes.

**Core Philosophy:** Education as a reciprocal relationship, not a one-way transaction. Teaching deepens understanding for both parties (protégé effect). Align financial incentives with pedagogical best practices.

## Strategic Goals

### GO-001: Validate the Learn-Teach-Earn Flywheel
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004

Prove that the peer teaching model creates real value and can scale:
- Students master courses → become Student-Teachers → earn 70% commission teaching others
- Creates new category vs. Coursera/Udemy's linear marketplace model
- Self-sustaining teaching capacity without requiring creator involvement in every session

### GO-002: Solve the 2 Sigma Problem at Scale
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004

Democratize the most effective form of learning (1-on-1 tutoring):
- Traditional online education: <10% completion, isolated learners, superficial familiarity
- Alpha Peer target: 75%+ completion, genuine mastery, community connection
- Make personalized tutoring affordable through peer network effects

### GO-003: Create Sustainable Income for All Participants
**Source:** CD-001, CD-002

Three-sided value creation:
- **Creators:** 15% perpetual royalty, community ownership tools, less time than traditional teaching
- **Student-Teachers:** 70% commission, earn while mastering material
- **Students:** Recoup 70% of course fee by teaching one peer
- **Platform:** 15% fee per transaction (potential creator subscription add-on)

---

## MVP Launch Goals

### GO-004: Genesis Cohort Launch
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004, CD-012, CD-029

Launch with founding course creators and their initial cohorts:
- Recruit 10-15 AI educators (Phase 1)
- Run Genesis cohorts to validate model (Phase 2)
- Ignite flywheel with proven results (Phase 3)
- Each creator builds 50+ active Student-Teachers
- **Genesis Target (refined):** 60-80 students across 4-5 courses (CD-012)
- **Operational Model:** Creators control their courses (certifications, payouts, new Student-Teachers); Platform = strategic oversight only (~3-4 hrs/week)

**Four Starter Courses Confirmed (Dec 15 Meeting - CD-029):**
| Course | Format | Creator | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Intro to GitHub | 1-2 sessions | Gabriel/Guy | Entry-level, broad appeal |
| Intro to Claude Code | 1-2 sessions | Gabriel/Guy | Entry-level, broad appeal |
| Intro to n8n | 1-2 sessions | Gabriel/Guy | Entry-level, n8n has "infinite funding" |
| AI Tools Overview | 1-2 sessions | Gabriel/Guy | Entry-level, broad appeal |

**Design Principles:**
- Quick flip courses (1-2 sessions max)
- Beginners only—no prior experience required
- Test the flywheel quickly
- Course materials in Markdown format
- Brian's YouTube Analogy: "These little beginner courses, if they had broad appeal, can build and show us the network effects."

### GO-018: MVP Budget & Timeline Constraint
**Source:** CD-008

Deliver MVP within defined constraints:
- **Budget:** $75,000
- **Timeline:** 4 months
- Rationale: Client willing to "take a bigger risk" after 6-8 months of preparation

## Quality & Experience Goals

### GO-014: Combat Isolation
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004

Create sense of connection that drives completion:
- Students don't want to let peers down
- Collaborative (not transactional) atmosphere
- Social peer pressure as positive motivation
- Community investment beyond individual consumption

### GO-015: Maintain Educational Quality
**Source:** CD-004

Peer teaching must equal or exceed traditional instruction:
- Creator vetting of student-turned-teachers
- Ongoing monitoring/assessment of Student-Teachers
- AI assistance when both teacher and student are stumped
- Certificate verification system

---

## Long-Term Vision Goals

### GO-016: Category Creation
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004

Build a new category in online education:
- Not competing with Coursera/Udemy—different model entirely
- Attract investment interest for expansion
- Other educators ask to implement similar models
- Prove that aligned incentives create better outcomes

### GO-017: Expansion Beyond AI
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004

AI education is strategic beachhead:
- Model expandable to any skill-based learning
- Proven flywheel becomes template for other domains
- Platform infrastructure supports diverse course types

---

## Trust & Conversion Goals

### GO-021: Trust-Building Before Purchase
**Source:** CD-029 (Brian's Review Comments)

Enable visitors to build trust before committing to high-ticket purchases on an unproven platform:

**The Problem:**
- New platform with no reviews or track record
- Asking visitors to pay $300-600 with zero human interaction is a significant barrier
- Platform sells live human interaction—visitors need to experience that BEFORE committing

**Brian's Suggested Solutions:**
1. **Pre-enrollment communication:** Basic "Contact Creator" or "Ask a Question" feature in Block 0.1
2. **Tiered pricing:** $150×3 courses instead of $450 single payment (lower entry barrier, faster H1 validation)
3. **Free intro sessions:** Free 15-minute intro session with Student-Teacher before payment
   - Visitor meets potential S-T
   - Discusses goals, sees how platform works
   - S-T answers questions, qualifies student
   - Demonstrates differentiation (live humans, not videos)
   - Reduces refund risk

**Success Metrics:**
- Conversion rate from visitor → enrolled student
- Free intro session → paid enrollment conversion rate
- Pre-enrollment inquiry → enrollment correlation
- Refund rate reduction

**Impact on Block Sequence:**
- Block 0.1 needs basic inquiry/contact feature (not full messaging)
- Free intro sessions may need simplified scheduling/BBB in Block 0.2
- Full messaging system can remain in Block 1.x

### GO-022: One-on-One Video as Core Value Proposition
**Source:** CD-029 (Dec 19 UX Meeting - Matt McCloskey)

Prioritize 1-on-1 live video instruction as the "lynchpin" of the concept:

**Matt McCloskey's Insight:**
- "The one-on-one live video instruction is the core value proposition and lynchpin of the concept, without which the idea loses coherence."
- Social media component depends on courses existing first
- Community risks becoming "random noise" without foundational course concepts

**Design Principles:**
- Define core concepts first: Creator, Instructor, Course, 1-on-1 video call
- Build features that cannot be removed without destroying entire concept
- Community features should be secondary in development order

**Validation:**
- Current block sequence (0.x = flywheel, 1.x = community) is correct priority
- Course-first for MVP, community-first for vision
- Mobile-first design critical for growth

### GO-023: Course Access Upon Payment
**Source:** CD-029 (Dec 15 Meeting)

Grant immediate community feed access upon course payment (changed from previous "after graduation" model):

**Fraser's Insight:** "You're doing session one of two. You need help after session one, but before session two, who do you turn to?"

**Brian's Response:** "I didn't understand until yesterday... having paid access to it makes perfect sense."

**Implementation:**
- Course community feed access granted immediately upon enrollment (not after certification)
- Students can seek help from community during learning journey
- Addresses isolation problem from day one
