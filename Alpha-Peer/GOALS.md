## Mission Statement

Launch Alpha Peer as a functioning peer-to-peer learning platform for AI education that solves the "2 Sigma Problem" by democratizing 1-on-1 tutoring. Validate that students who complete courses transition to paid Student-Teachers, proving the learn-teach-earn flywheel creates self-sustaining teaching capacity and genuinely better learning outcomes.

**Core Philosophy:** Education as a reciprocal relationship, not a one-way transaction. Teaching deepens understanding for both parties (protégé effect). Align financial incentives with pedagogical best practices.

## Strategic Goals

### GO-001: Validate the Learn-Teach-Earn Flywheel
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004

Prove that the peer teaching model creates real value and can scale:
- Students master courses → become Student-Teachers → earn 70% commission teaching others
- Creates new category vs. Coursera/Udemy's linear marketplace model
- Self-sustaining teaching capacity without requiring creator involvement in every session

### GO-002: Solve the 2 Sigma Problem at Scale
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004

Democratize the most effective form of learning (1-on-1 tutoring):
- Traditional online education: <10% completion, isolated learners, superficial familiarity
- Alpha Peer target: 75%+ completion, genuine mastery, community connection
- Make personalized tutoring affordable through peer network effects

### GO-003: Create Sustainable Income for All Participants
**Source:** CD-001, CD-002

Three-sided value creation:
- **Creators:** 15% perpetual royalty, community ownership tools, less time than traditional teaching
- **Student-Teachers:** 70% commission, earn while mastering material
- **Students:** Recoup 70% of course fee by teaching one peer
- **Platform:** 15% fee per transaction (potential creator subscription add-on)

## MVP Launch Goals

### GO-004: Genesis Cohort Launch
**Source:** CD-001, CD-004

Launch with three founding course creators and their initial cohorts:
- Recruit 10-15 AI educators (Phase 1)
- Run Genesis cohorts to validate model (Phase 2)
- Ignite flywheel with proven results (Phase 3)
- Each creator builds 50+ active Student-Teachers
