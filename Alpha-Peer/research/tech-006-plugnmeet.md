**Service:** PlugNmeet
**Type:** Video Conferencing / Virtual Classroom
**Website:** https://www.plugnmeet.org/
**Source:** CD-028 (Brian LeBlanc Slack message, Dec 24, 2025)
**Status:** ✅ SELECTED (2025-12-26)

---

## Overview

PlugNmeet positions itself as a **"modern BigBlueButton replacement"** - open-source like BBB but built with newer technology (WebRTC/LiveKit). Brian discovered this after concerns were raised that BBB's software is "quite old and dated."

**Key Value Proposition:**
- Modern, Zoom-like interface (vs BBB's clunky UI)
- Same classroom features as BBB
- Better scalability due to microservices architecture
- Pay-per-session or flat server cost model

---

## Pricing

| Model | Cost | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Self-Hosted** | Free (VPS cost only) | $5-10/month for VPS, flat rate regardless of user count |
| **Cloud (Flex Plan)** | Flat monthly fee | Based on concurrent usage/capacity, NOT registered users |

**vs BBB/Blindside Networks:** BBB typically charges per-session fees. PlugNmeet's flat rate model could be more cost-effective for high-volume usage.

---

## Interface & UX

- **Modern, responsive, customizable**
- Looks more like **Zoom or Google Meet** than traditional LMS/BBB interfaces
- Drops the "clunky interface" of BBB while keeping classroom features

---

## Features

### Core Video Features
- HD video
- Screen sharing
- Waiting rooms
- Breakout rooms

### Classroom/Education Tools
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Whiteboard** | Upload PDFs or Office documents and draw on them |
| **Breakout Rooms** | Essential for group work |
| **Polls & Voting** | Instant student feedback |
| **Shared Notepad** | Collaborative note-taking during lecture |
| **Moderator Controls** | Lock students' mics, webcams, or chat permissions (critical for maintaining order) |

### Accessibility
- **AI-powered "Meeting Agent"**
- Live speech-to-text
- Translations
- Significant plus for accessibility compliance

### LMS Integration
- Ready-made plugins for **Moodle, WordPress, Joomla**
- Students can join directly from course pages without separate login
- Retains the deep Moodle/LMS integration that makes BBB popular

---

## Scalability

**Verdict: Highly scalable - more so than BBB**

### BBB Limitations (Why PlugNmeet is Better)
- BBB is **"monolithic"** - heavy and difficult to split across servers
- Scaling BBB requires load balancer redirecting to completely separate servers (adds cost and complexity)

### PlugNmeet Architecture
- Built on **Go and LiveKit** (modern WebRTC infrastructure)
- Uses **microservices approach**

### Scaling Tiers

| Scale | Capability |
|-------|------------|
| **Small** | Single robust server handles hundreds of concurrent users (lightweight software) |
| **Large** | Separate "heavy lifting" components (e.g., Recording engine on cheap separate server so live video isn't slowed) |
| **Massive** | Cluster media servers - distribute video streams across multiple servers while keeping them in same "session" logic. Can handle 1,000+ students |

---

## Fit for PeerLoop

### Alignment with Requirements

| Requirement | PlugNmeet Support |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1:1 tutoring sessions | ✅ Lightweight, cost-effective for small sessions |
| Group sessions | ✅ Breakout rooms, scales to many concurrent users |
| Recording | ✅ Can run recording on separate server |
| LMS/Course integration | ✅ Plugin ecosystem (though we'd need custom integration) |
| Modern UX | ✅ Zoom-like interface vs BBB's dated look |
| Pay-per-session model | ✅ Self-hosted = flat cost regardless of sessions |
| Education-specific features | ✅ Whiteboard, polls, shared notepad, moderator controls |
| Accessibility | ✅ AI transcription and translation |

### Potential Concerns
- **Newer/less established** than BBB (need to verify production stability)
- **Custom integration needed** - not using Moodle/WordPress plugins directly
- **Self-hosted complexity** - need to manage infrastructure (vs Blindside Networks managed BBB)

---

## Comparison: PlugNmeet vs BBB

| Aspect | BigBlueButton | PlugNmeet |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Architecture | Monolithic | Microservices (Go + LiveKit) |
| Interface | Traditional LMS look | Modern Zoom-like |
| Scalability | Difficult (load balancer) | Easy (component separation) |
| Self-hosted cost | Complex setup | $5-10/month VPS |
| Managed hosting | Blindside Networks (per-session) | Cloud Flex Plan (capacity-based) |
| Education features | ✅ Full | ✅ Full (equivalent) |
| LMS plugins | Moodle, WordPress, etc. | Moodle, WordPress, Joomla |
| AI features | Limited | Meeting Agent (transcription, translation) |
| Maturity | Established (10+ years) | Newer (needs verification) |

---

## Decision Summary (2025-12-26)

**PlugNmeet selected as video platform for PeerLoop.**

### Why PlugNmeet over BBB:
1. Modern Zoom-like interface (better UX for students)
2. Better scalability architecture (microservices vs monolithic)
3. Lower cost (~$10/mo VPS vs $80-150/mo for BBB)
4. AI accessibility features built-in (transcription, translation)
5. Same classroom features (whiteboard, breakout rooms, polls)
6. Full API coverage for our VideoProvider interface

## Mapping to PeerLoop VideoProvider Interface

| VideoProvider Method | PlugNmeet Endpoint | Notes |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `createRoom()` | `POST /room/create` | ✅ Full support |
| `deleteRoom()` | `POST /room/endRoom` | ✅ Ends active session |
| `getJoinUrl()` | `POST /room/getJoinToken` | ✅ Returns token for URL |
| `startRecording()` | Room feature or webhook | Use `enable_auto_cloud_recording` |
| `stopRecording()` | Via room end or API | Recording stops with room |
| `getRecording()` | `POST /recording/fetch` | ✅ Full support |
| `getRoomStatus()` | `POST /room/isRoomActive` | ✅ Full support |

**Webhook Integration:**
- `room_finished` → Update session status in DB
- `recording_proceeded` → Trigger R2 replication
- `participant_joined/left` → Track attendance

---

## Data Persistence & Session History

### What PlugNmeet Stores (Queryable via API)

| API | Data Available | Limitation |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| `/room/fetchPastRooms` | Room title, room_id, room_sid, participant count, created/ended timestamps | Aggregated - no individual user data |
| `/analytics/fetch` | File metadata, room-level stats | Deprecated; no per-user breakdown |
| `/recording/fetch` | Recording files by room_id | Files only, not user data |

**Key limitation:** PlugNmeet uses its own `user_id` namespace. When you call `getJoinToken`, you pass your user ID, but PlugNmeet doesn't maintain a queryable database linking "PeerLoop user X attended sessions Y and Z."

### What Must Be Captured via Webhooks

| Webhook Event | Data to Store in PeerLoop DB |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| `participant_joined` | user_id, room_id, timestamp → attendance start |
| `participant_left` | user_id, room_id, timestamp → attendance end |
| `room_finished` | room_id, timestamp → session completion |
| `recording_proceeded` | room_id, file info → link recording to session |

### PeerLoop Database Design for Session Tracking

```
sessions table
├── session_id (PeerLoop ID)
├── plugnmeet_room_id
├── plugnmeet_room_sid
├── status, started_at, ended_at
└── recording_url

session_attendance table
├── session_id
├── user_id (PeerLoop user)
├── joined_at, left_at
└── duration_seconds
```

### Webhook Handler Pattern

```typescript
// POST /api/webhooks/plugnmeet
switch (event.event) {
  case 'participant_joined':
    await db.sessionAttendance.create({
      sessionId: lookupByRoomId(event.room.identity),
      userId: event.participant.identity, // PeerLoop user_id passed at join
      joinedAt: new Date()
    });
    break;
  case 'participant_left':
    await db.sessionAttendance.update({
      leftAt: new Date(),
      durationSeconds: calculateDuration()
    });
    break;
  case 'room_finished':
    await db.sessions.update({
      status: 'completed',
      endedAt: new Date()
    });
    break;
  case 'recording_proceeded':
    await replicateToR2(event.recording_info);
    await db.sessions.update({
      recordingUrl: r2Url
    });
    break;
}
```

**Bottom line:** Webhooks are required for user-level session data. PlugNmeet's API provides room-level history, but attendance tracking per user must be built by listening to `participant_joined/left` events.
