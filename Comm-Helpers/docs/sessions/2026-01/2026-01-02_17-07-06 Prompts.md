# Session Prompts — 2026-01-02

1. `/par-resume`

2. `y` (confirming ready to start validation)

3. `1. I have a slack thread that span 2 days (not sequential)` [with screenshot of Dec 2-3 translation-system thread]

4. `IN the case of a multi-day spanning thread, consider each day as a separate JSON, even if they are connected. Certainly not the continuation if you see one but keep them as separate outputs with the headings distinct`

5. `yes! update the skill with this feedback`

6. `update PLAN, then we'll continue`

7. `Check your /r-slack skill: when you find a file attachment, an image or an audio with transcript. I thought you were supposed to create a separate section "Attachments" with the filename and details. Also a heading was intended for "URLS"`

8. `I like the inline with the discussion. It's great contents. Still a section where there are listed is valuable too`

9. `Can you show me the updated output for those 2 days?`

10. `try another thread` [with screenshot of Dec 17 translation-system thread]

11. `5` (selecting translation-system channel)

12. `Here's another one` [with screenshot of Dec 18 translation-system thread]

13. `update PLAN`

14. `The Obsidian Paste workflow is perfect as is. I have pasted all the threads you have analyzed. Only post paste process was to highlight the pasted section and press Shift-Tab to remove the single space in front of every line but the first ### line`

15. `lets do a /par-end-session and then I am going to backfill Obsidian using the skill`
