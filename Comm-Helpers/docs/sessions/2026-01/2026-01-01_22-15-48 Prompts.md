# Session Prompts — 2026-01-01

## Prompts Used This Session

1. the /par-end-session calls /par-prompts. I want it also to call /par-decisions right afterwards

2. I need a PLAN. Do you have enough information in CLAUDE.md and PURPOSE.md to create a basic PLAN. We will be updating it as needed as we go

3. Let's begin

4. This is what a slack conversation looks like when using the mouse to highlight the section: [provided text example + screenshot]

5. Just an explanation. Every time a user post a message it gets a new line. If 2 messages from the same user are close together in time, then there is no avatar or time written to the screen. Also a user can force a new line inside the same message and so it also looks like a new message but isn't. I want you to test the text-only version and then see if we get better/more detailed threads if we started with screenshots

6. add screenshot guidance to the skill

7. Process this slack image [screenshot]

8. You have given a summary of the whole conversation. Certain aspects of what can be said in threads will seem important and emphasized. Maybe certain assertions are made by people in the thread. These need to be highlighted, yet still succinct. Can you do that?

9. yes update the skill

10. How do I routinely add a thread to be analyzed by the skill when it's text or when its a screen capture?

11. yes update the skill

12. Sometimes files can be included or voice recordings here is an example with a voice recording and 2 images [screenshot]

13. Not yet. Please consider. 1) if you see a voice recording without the full transcription, point that out and exit so I can expand the transcription and retake the screen shot. 2) 2 images were seen: I need them listed by filename in order. 3) Tasks that I have agreed to do (or offered to do) should be in their own sections and display as markdown tasks. 4) The Decisions need and Watching For sections should also have entries which are markdown tasks

14. yes update the skill

15. test it with that screenshot again [screenshot]

16. I think I am going to submit the audio transcription with the screenshot (not afterwards)

17. yes update the skill

18. Here is a Slack thread image + audio transcript [transcript + screenshot]

19. Here is another test: a screenshot of a thread with a huge text file partially shown and URLs. The filename is visible so we DO NOT want the user to reveal it [screenshot]

20. yes add links to the skill

21. The next test involves responses in threads. If you see "1 reply" or X "replies" and the Thread panel isn't on the right in the image, then prompt me to open the thread panel and re-capture [screenshot with annotations]

22. test with an unexpanded thread [screenshot]

23. Here is the updated screenshot with thread showing [screenshot]

24. Here is the missing audio transcript: [transcript]

25. If any key point includes data from the audio transcript, then add (audio) at the end of the key point

26. yes add it to the skill. And add a section for unique participants in the thread

27. add to the PLAN that we will next specify the exact format of a markdown file to write for each thread we submit
