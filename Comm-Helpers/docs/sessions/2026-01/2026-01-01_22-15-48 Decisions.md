# Session Decisions — 2026-01-01

## Decision 1: Skill Architecture

**Context**: Designing the thread processing skill system

**Options Considered**:
1. Universal skill — One `/r-thread` skill that auto-detects platform from content
2. Per-platform skills — Separate `/r-slack`, `/r-email`, `/r-telegram` ← Chosen

**Decision**: Create separate skills per platform

**Rationale**: Tailored prompts for each format's quirks; explicit user choice; easier to maintain platform-specific logic

## Decision 2: User Identification

**Context**: How the skill knows which actions belong to "me" vs others

**Options Considered**:
1. Hardcode in skill — Put name directly in skill file ← Chosen
2. Ask each time — Skill prompts "Who are you in this thread?"
3. Argument to skill — Pass as arg: `/r-slack @john`

**Decision**: Hardcode "Fraser Gorrie" in skill files

**Rationale**: Zero friction during use; easy to update if names change; avoids repetitive prompting

## Decision 3: Screenshot vs Text Input

**Context**: Testing revealed text selection misses information

**Options Considered**:
1. Text-only input
2. Screenshot input ← Preferred for completeness
3. Either, with guidance

**Decision**: Support both, but recommend screenshots when reactions/confirmations matter

**Rationale**: Screenshots capture "Sent." confirmations, reactions, and completion signals that text selection misses

## Decision 4: Audio Transcript Handling

**Context**: Voice recordings show partial transcripts in Slack; full transcript opens in modal

**Options Considered**:
1. Ask user to retake screenshot with expanded transcript
2. Ask for transcript text as follow-up after screenshot
3. User provides transcript alongside screenshot ← Chosen

**Decision**: User submits transcript text with the screenshot

**Rationale**: Simpler workflow; Slack's "View transcript" opens in a modal (not inline), so retaking screenshot doesn't help

## Decision 5: Output Sections Structure

**Context**: Distinguishing different types of action items

**Options Considered**:
1. Single "Actions" section for everything
2. Separate sections by action type ← Chosen

**Decision**: Create distinct sections: My Commitments, Decisions Needed, Watching For

**Rationale**: Clearer separation of what I owe vs what I'm owed vs what I need to decide; maps better to task management workflow

---

## Decision 6: Participant Listing

**Context**: Where to show who was in the thread

**Options Considered**:
1. Embed in Source metadata line
2. Separate Participants section ← Chosen

**Decision**: Create dedicated Participants section

**Rationale**: Cleaner format; allows "(mentioned)" notation for people referenced but not present; easier to scan
