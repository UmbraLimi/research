# Session Learnings — 2026-01-02

## Workflow

- **Multi-day thread splitting:** Slack threads spanning multiple calendar days should produce separate outputs per day, enabling paste into respective Daily Notes
- **Dual-purpose attachments/links:** Include both inline references in Discussion (for narrative context) AND dedicated `#### Attachments` and `#### Links` sections (as inventory)

## Technical

- Skill output format works well for Obsidian paste workflow
- **Minor friction:** Single leading space appears on all lines except first `###` when pasting — workaround is highlight + Shift-Tab

## Process

- Validation with real threads surfaces practical issues that upfront design didn't anticipate
- 4 real threads was sufficient to validate the skill and identify refinements needed
- Iterating on the skill during validation (fixing issues as found) is more effective than batching all changes
