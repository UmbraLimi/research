# Session Learnings — 2026-01-03

## Skill Refinements

- **Relative dates in screenshots:** When Slack shows "Today" or "Yesterday" in date headers, ask user for actual date before processing
- **"Sent" implies expect task:** When someone confirms they sent something, create `[[expect]] - [[Person]] to deliver [object]` task
- **Future intent also triggers expect:** "I will send...", "They will probably send..." should also create expect tasks
- **Long threads:** Process one day at a time for very long multi-day threads to avoid errors and maintain accuracy
- **Always ask channel:** Even when context suggests the channel, always ask to confirm — the pre-processing check exists for a reason

## Workflow

- **Backfill sessions:** The `/r-slack` skill works well for processing historical threads for Obsidian Daily Notes backfill
- **Rick DM added:** New Via channel `[[Slack • CFU • DM • Rick]]` added to reference tables

## Technical

- Processed ~15 Slack threads across CFU (#translation-system, DM Rick, DM Gabriel) and AIM (#peer-loop-team) workspaces
- Multi-day threads with 3+ reply panels can be handled by providing separate screenshots for each reply section
