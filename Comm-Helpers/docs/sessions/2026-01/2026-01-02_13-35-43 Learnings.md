# Session Learnings — 2026-01-02 (continued)

## Command Naming Conventions

- **`/par-*` should mean "parent-level, available from subfolders"** — not "affects parent scope"
- **`/repo-*` for repo-wide operations** — clearer than overloading `/par-*` prefix
- Renamed `/par-commit` → `/repo-commit` to eliminate ambiguity

## Session Workflow

- **Always attempt PLAN.md update** — Don't skip based on recent modification time
- Recent changes may have been for different purposes than capturing session progress
- Full review with session context catches items that quick edits miss

## Session Files Location

- `/par-*` skills use relative paths (`docs/sessions/`)
- Files are created relative to current working directory
- Launch Claude Code from project folder to ensure local session docs
- Both parent-level (`/MyResearch/docs/sessions/`) and project-level (`/Comm-Helpers/docs/sessions/`) can coexist
