# Session Decisions — 2026-01-02 (continued)

## Decision 1: Rename /par-commit to /repo-commit

**Context**: Command naming was ambiguous — `/par-commit` suggested "parent-level" but meant "repo-wide"

**Options Considered**:
1. `/repo-commit` — explicit about repository scope ← Chosen
2. `/all-commit` — suggests "all changes"
3. `/root-commit` — suggests from root level
4. `/global-commit` — suggests global scope

**Decision**: Rename to `/repo-commit`

**Rationale**: Clearest and most explicit. `/par-*` now consistently means "parent-level commands available from subfolders" while `/repo-*` means "repo-wide operations"

## Decision 2: Always Update PLAN.md in End-Session

**Context**: `/par-end-session` was asking whether to update PLAN.md, sometimes skipping based on recent modification

**Options Considered**:
1. Keep asking user whether to update
2. Always attempt update ← Chosen

**Decision**: Always run `/par-update` in end-session workflow

**Rationale**: Recent PLAN.md changes may have been for different purposes (e.g., adding a single item). Full session review with context catches items that quick edits miss.
