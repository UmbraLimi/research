# Session Prompts — 2026-01-02

## Prompts (in sequence)

1. `/par-resume` — Resume work on Comm-Helpers project

2. Yes. But I think we need to add a JSON intermediate format. After the text or image thread has been parsed, we have been creating a markdown output directly... Let's discuss this whole note I am making.

3. So far, what you have provided as output has been missing the markdown task format or headings, so I am assuming that you can't do that
   — *Led to discovery that code blocks preserve raw markdown for copy-paste*

4. [Screenshot of Daily Notes format] We need to integrate with my Obsidian Daily Notes... I want to expand upon my manual format by adding what you are collecting

5. 1. The emoji are equivalent to Projects in Obsidian... 2. Yes - I have a highly interlinked note system. 3. Merge your notes into the Discussion heading. Create a new section called Tasks

6. Here are all of the possible entries for "Via". You will not see anything in the thread to identify which Via...
   — *Provided channel list, led to reference file creation*

7. [Screenshot of real Slack thread] Sometimes I will be able to capture the name of the Slack Channel if I include the placeholder text from the chat input

8. Yes. This is a real thread I want to paste into Obsidian
   — *First real test of skill*

9. add watching for Carlos translation as a Task... I would like you to imply as much as you want in your tasks. Better to erase those I don't agree with than miss one

10. Also, I am thinking about the possibility that I could paste in this markdown into the wrong Daily note. So lets add a Date::

11. When you see me in the thread as a speaker, assume a first person narrative at that point and use "I" instead of "[[Fraser Gorrie]]"

12. Now I just need you to remove the linefeed between sections. The CSS makes heading very high

13. The /par- skills in the parent folder all work, when invoked, from the local folder (please confirm) except /par-commit
    — *Led to /repo-commit rename*

14. update the /par-end-session skill to no longer assess a priori whether the PLAN needs updating. ALWAYS attempt to update the PLAN

## Key Prompt Patterns

- **Screenshot + context** — Providing real examples with explanation drives better understanding
- **Iterative refinement** — Small adjustments ("add Date::", "remove linefeeds") after seeing output
- **Explicit preferences** — "Better to over-identify than miss" establishes clear direction
- **Naming clarity** — Questioning ambiguous names leads to better conventions
