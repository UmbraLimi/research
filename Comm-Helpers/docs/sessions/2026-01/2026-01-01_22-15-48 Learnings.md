# Session Learnings — 2026-01-01

## Skill Development

- **Per-platform skills preferred over universal**: Platform-specific skills (e.g., `/r-slack`) allow tailored prompts for format quirks rather than trying to auto-detect
- **Hardcoding user identity is zero-friction**: Putting "Fraser Gorrie" directly in the skill avoids repetitive prompts; easy to update if needed
- **Screenshots capture more than text selection**: Reactions, "Sent" confirmations, and completion signals often get lost when copy-pasting text from Slack

## Output Format Design

- **Key Points should capture assertions, not summaries**: Quote or paraphrase what people actually said/committed to, not generic descriptions of what happened
- **Separate sections for different action types**:
  - "My Commitments" — things I agreed/offered to do
  - "Decisions Needed" — decisions required of me
  - "Watching For" — commitments others made
- **Participants section is cleaner than embedding in Source line**: Allows for "(mentioned)" notation for people referenced but not present
- **Audio annotation with (audio)** helps trace where information came from

## Pre-Processing Checks

- **Thread replies must be expanded**: If "X replies" visible but Thread panel not shown, prompt user to expand before processing
- **Audio transcripts should accompany screenshots**: User provides transcript text alongside screenshot (Slack's "View transcript" opens in modal, not inline)
- **Attachments listed by filename in order**: Images use filename, audio uses `Audio (@person, time, duration)` format
- **Links section for URLs**: Meeting invites, shared docs, and resources worth tracking

## Workflow Insights

- **Iterative refinement works**: Testing with real screenshots revealed gaps (missing "Sent." confirmation, incomplete transcripts) that wouldn't have been caught with synthetic examples
- **User knows their workflow best**: Adjusted transcript handling based on actual Slack UI behavior (modal vs inline expansion)
