# Session Decisions — 2026-01-02

## Decision 1: Multi-day Thread Handling

**Context**: Processing a Slack thread that spanned December 2-3, 2025

**Options Considered**:
1. Combine into single output with date range (e.g., `Date:: 2025-12-02 to 2025-12-03`)
2. Split into separate outputs per calendar day ← Chosen

**Decision**: Multi-day threads produce separate markdown blocks for each calendar day

**Rationale**: Each day's output pastes into its respective Daily Note in Obsidian. Combining would require manual splitting or pasting into the wrong day's note.

## Decision 2: Attachments and Links Display

**Context**: Determining how to present attachments and links in the output

**Options Considered**:
1. Inline only in Discussion section (contextual narrative)
2. Dedicated `#### Attachments` and `#### Links` sections only (inventory)
3. Both inline AND dedicated sections ← Chosen

**Decision**: Include attachments/links inline in Discussion for context, AND as dedicated sections for inventory

**Rationale**: Inline references tell the story (e.g., "shared `architecture.png` showing current setup"). Dedicated sections provide a clean list for reference. Both serve different purposes.
