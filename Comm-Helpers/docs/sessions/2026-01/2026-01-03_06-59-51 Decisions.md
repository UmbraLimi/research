# Session Decisions — 2026-01-03

## Decision 1: Always Ask Channel Even When Context Suggests Answer

**Context**: Processing a thread where channel wasn't visible but context from prior threads suggested translation-system

**Options Considered**:
1. Assume channel based on conversation context
2. Always ask user to confirm channel ← Chosen

**Decision**: Always ask which channel, even when context makes it seem obvious

**Rationale**: The pre-processing check exists for a reason. Assumptions can be wrong and lead to incorrect Via links in output.

## Decision 2: Process Long Multi-Day Threads One Day at a Time

**Context**: A very long Dec 23 thread with extensive discussion caused accuracy issues when processed all at once

**Options Considered**:
1. Process entire multi-day thread at once
2. Process one day at a time for long threads ← Chosen

**Decision**: For very long threads, process one calendar day at a time

**Rationale**: Reduces errors, maintains accuracy, and produces cleaner output that's easier to verify.

## Decision 3: Expect Tasks for "Sent" and Future Intent Statements

**Context**: When someone says "Sent" or "I will send...", this implies something Fraser should expect to receive

**Options Considered**:
1. Only create expect tasks for explicit commitments
2. Also create expect tasks for "Sent" confirmations and future intent statements ← Chosen

**Decision**: Create `[[expect]]` tasks when someone confirms sending something OR states future intent to send/do something

**Rationale**: Better to track implied deliverables than miss them. User can delete if not needed.

## Decision 4: Decision Task Attribution (OP-14)

**Context**: Not all "Decide:" tasks are Fraser's to make

**Options Considered**:
1. Always use `Decide:` format (assumes Fraser)
2. Attribute to correct decision-maker ← Chosen

**Decision**: Format based on who decides:
- Fraser decides: `Decide: [description]`
- Another person: `[[expect]] - [[Person]] to decide [description]`
- Group: `We need to decide: [description]`
- Unclear: `Decide (Who?): [description]`

**Rationale**: Accurate attribution helps route decisions correctly.

## Decision 5: Phase 1 Edge Case Scan Before Content Extraction

**Context**: Reply indicators ("2 replies") were missed in a screenshot because content was being extracted before systematically scanning for edge cases

**Options Considered**:
1. Remember to check for replies during this session (ephemeral)
2. Update skill file with explicit Phase 1 scan step ← Chosen

**Decision**: Restructured `/r-slack` into 4 phases with Phase 1 being an explicit edge case scan for replies, audio transcripts, attachments, URLs, and huddles

**Rationale**: Ephemeral fixes don't persist across sessions. Updating the skill file makes the behavior durable.

## Decision 6: Pause for Reply Text Instead of Recapture

**Context**: When reply indicators are found, the old behavior asked user to recapture screenshot with thread panel expanded

**Options Considered**:
1. Ask user to recapture screenshot (old behavior)
2. Ask user to paste reply text ← Chosen

**Decision**: When reply indicators or audio transcripts found, pause and ask user to paste the text content

**Rationale**: More efficient — user can paste text directly without leaving the conversation to recapture. Added "skip" option for inconsequential items.
